 epilogue
 the tragedy of birlstone
 the warning
 i am inclined to think-- said i <fullstop>
 i believe that i am one of the most long-suffering of mortals but
 ill admit that i was annoyed at the sardonic interruption <fullstop>
 really <comma> holmes <comma> said i severely <comma> you are a little trying at
 times <fullstop>
 he was too much absorbed with his own thoughts to give any immediate
 answer to my remonstrance <fullstop> he leaned upon his hand <comma> with his untasted
 breakfast before him <comma> and he stared at the slip of paper which he had
 just drawn from its envelope <fullstop> then he took the envelope itself <comma> held
 it up to the light <comma> and very carefully studied both the exterior and
 the flap <fullstop>
 it is porlocks writing <comma> said he thoughtfully <fullstop> i can hardly doubt
 that it is porlocks writing <comma> though i have seen it only twice
 before <fullstop> the greek e with the peculiar top flourish is distinctive <fullstop>
 but if it is porlock <comma> then it must be something of the very first
 importance <fullstop>
 he was speaking to himself rather than to me but my vexation
 disappeared in the interest which the words awakened <fullstop>
 who then is porlock <question> i asked <fullstop>
 porlock <comma> watson <comma> is a nom-de-plume <comma> a mere identification mark but
 behind it lies a shifty and evasive personality <fullstop> in a former letter
 he frankly informed me that the name was not his own <comma> and defied me
 ever to trace him among the teeming millions of this great city <fullstop>
 porlock is important <comma> not for himself <comma> but for the great man with
 whom he is in touch <fullstop> picture to yourself the pilot fish with the
 shark <comma> the jackal with the lion--anything that is insignificant in
 companionship with what is formidable not only formidable <comma> watson <comma>
 but sinister--in the highest degree sinister <fullstop> that is where he comes
 within my purview <fullstop> you have heard me speak of professor moriarty <question>
 the famous scientific criminal <comma> as famous among crooks as--
 my blushes <comma> watson holmes murmured in a deprecating voice <fullstop>
 i was about to say <comma> as he is unknown to the public <fullstop>
 a touch a distinct touch cried holmes <fullstop> you are developing a
 certain unexpected vein of pawky humour <comma> watson <comma> against which i must
 learn to guard myself <fullstop> but in calling moriarty a criminal you are
 uttering libel in the eyes of the law--and there lie the glory and
 the wonder of it the greatest schemer of all time <comma> the organizer of
 every deviltry <comma> the controlling brain of the underworld <comma> a brain
 which might have made or marred the destiny of nations--thats the
 man but so aloof is he from general suspicion <comma> so immune from
 criticism <comma> so admirable in his management and self-effacement <comma> that
 for those very words that you have uttered he could hale you to a
 court and emerge with your years pension as a solatium for his
 wounded character <fullstop> is he not the celebrated author of the dynamics of
 an asteroid <comma> a book which ascends to such rarefied heights of pure
 mathematics that it is said that there was no man in the scientific
 press capable of criticizing it <question> is this a man to traduce <question>
 foul-mouthed doctor and slandered professor--such would be your
 respective roles thats genius <comma> watson <fullstop> but if i am spared by lesser
 men <comma> our day will surely come <fullstop>
 may i be there to see i exclaimed devoutly <fullstop> but you were speaking
 of this man porlock <fullstop>
 ah <comma> yes--the so-called porlock is a link in the chain some little
 way from its great attachment <fullstop> porlock is not quite a sound
 link--between ourselves <fullstop> he is the only flaw in that chain so far as
 i have been able to test it <fullstop>
 but no chain is stronger than its weakest link <fullstop>
 exactly <comma> my dear watson hence the extreme importance of porlock <fullstop>
 led on by some rudimentary aspirations towards right <comma> and encouraged
 by the judicious stimulation of an occasional ten-pound note sent to
 him by devious methods <comma> he has once or twice given me advance
 information which has been of value--that highest value which
 anticipates and prevents rather than avenges crime <fullstop> i cannot doubt
 that <comma> if we had the cipher <comma> we should find that this communication is
 of the nature that i indicate <fullstop>
 again holmes flattened out the paper upon his unused plate <fullstop> i rose
 and <comma> leaning over him <comma> stared down at the curious inscription <comma> which
 ran as follows
 534 c2 13 127 36 31 4 17 21 41
 douglas 109 293 5 37 birlstone
 26 birlstone 9 47 171
 what do you make of it <comma> holmes <question>
 it is obviously an attempt to convey secret information <fullstop>
 but what is the use of a cipher message without the cipher <question>
 in this instance <comma> none at all <fullstop>
 why do you say in this instance <question>
 because there are many ciphers which i would read as easily as i do
 the apocrypha of the agony column such crude devices amuse the
 intelligence without fatiguing it <fullstop> but this is different <fullstop> it is
 clearly a reference to the words in a page of some book <fullstop> until i am
 told which page and which book i am powerless <fullstop>
 but why douglas and birlstone <question>
 clearly because those are words which were not contained in the page
 in question <fullstop>
 then why has he not indicated the book <question>
 your native shrewdness <comma> my dear watson <comma> that innate cunning which is
 the delight of your friends <comma> would surely prevent you from inclosing
 cipher and message in the same envelope <fullstop> should it miscarry <comma> you are
 undone <fullstop> as it is <comma> both have to go wrong before any harm comes from
 it <fullstop> our second post is now overdue <comma> and i shall be surprised if it
 does not bring us either a further letter of explanation <comma> or <comma> as is
 more probable <comma> the very volume to which these figures refer <fullstop>
 holmess calculation was fulfilled within a very few minutes by the
 appearance of billy <comma> the page <comma> with the very letter which we were
 expecting <fullstop>
 the same writing <comma> remarked holmes <comma> as he opened the envelope <comma> and
 actually signed <comma> he added in an exultant voice as he unfolded the
 epistle <fullstop> come <comma> we are getting on <comma> watson <fullstop> his brow clouded <comma>
 however <comma> as he glanced over the contents <fullstop>
 dear me <comma> this is very disappointing i fear <comma> watson <comma> that all our
 expectations come to nothing <fullstop> i trust that the man porlock will come
 to no harm <fullstop>
 dear mr <fullstop> holmes he says
 i will go no further in this matter <fullstop> it is too dangerous--he
 suspects me <fullstop> i can see that he suspects me <fullstop> he came to me quite
 unexpectedly after i had actually addressed this envelope with the
 intention of sending you the key to the cipher <fullstop> i was able to cover
 it up <fullstop> if he had seen it <comma> it would have gone hard with me <fullstop> but i read
 suspicion in his eyes <fullstop> please burn the cipher message <comma> which can now
 be of no use to you <fullstop>
 fred porlock <fullstop>
 holmes sat for some little time twisting this letter between his
 fingers <comma> and frowning <comma> as he stared into the fire <fullstop>
 after all <comma> he said at last <comma> there may be nothing in it <fullstop> it may be
 only his guilty conscience <fullstop> knowing himself to be a traitor <comma> he may
 have read the accusation in the others eyes <fullstop>
 the other being <comma> i presume <comma> professor moriarty <fullstop>
 mean <fullstop> there is one predominant he for all of them <fullstop>
 but what can he do <question>
 hum thats a large question <fullstop> when you have one of the first brains
 of europe up against you <comma> and all the powers of darkness at his back <comma>
 there are infinite possibilities <fullstop> anyhow <comma> friend porlock is evidently
 scared out of his senses--kindly compare the writing in the note to
 that upon its envelope which was done <comma> he tells us <comma> before this
 ill-omened visit <fullstop> the one is clear and firm <fullstop> the other hardly
 legible <fullstop>
 why did he write at all <question> why did he not simply drop it <question>
 because he feared i would make some inquiry after him in that case <comma>
 and possibly bring trouble on him <fullstop>
 no doubt <comma> said i <fullstop> of course <fullstop> i had picked up the original cipher
 message and was bending my brows over it <fullstop> its pretty maddening to
 think that an important secret may lie here on this slip of paper <comma>
 and that it is beyond human power to penetrate it <fullstop>
 unsavoury pipe which was the companion of his deepest meditations <fullstop> i
 wonder said he <comma> leaning back and staring at the ceiling <fullstop> perhaps
 there are points which have escaped your machiavellian intellect <fullstop> let
 us consider the problem in the light of pure reason <fullstop> this mans
 a somewhat vague one <fullstop>
 let us see then if we can narrow it down <fullstop> as i focus my mind upon
 it <comma> it seems rather less impenetrable <fullstop> what indications have we as to
 this book <question>
 none <fullstop>
 well <comma> well <comma> it is surely not quite so bad as that <fullstop> the cipher
 message begins with a large 534 <comma> does it not <question> we may take it as a
 cipher refers <fullstop> so our book has already become a large book which is
 surely something gained <fullstop> what other indications have we as to the
 nature of this large book <question> the next sign is c2 <fullstop> what do you make of
 that <comma> watson <question>
 hardly that <comma> watson <fullstop> you will <comma> i am sure <comma> agree with me that if the
 one must have been really intolerable <fullstop>
 column i cried <fullstop>
 brilliant <comma> watson <fullstop> you are scintillating this morning <fullstop> if it is not
 column <comma> then i am very much deceived <fullstop> so now <comma> you see <comma> we begin to
 visualize a large book printed in double columns which are each of a
 considerable length <comma> since one of the words is numbered in the
 document as the two hundred and ninety-third <fullstop> have we reached the
 limits of what reason can supply <question>
 i fear that we have <fullstop>
 surely you do yourself an injustice <fullstop> one more coruscation <comma> my dear
 watson--yet another brain-wave had the volume been an unusual one <comma>
 he would have sent it to me <fullstop> instead of that <comma> he had intended <comma> before
 his plans were nipped <comma> to send me the clue in this envelope <fullstop> he says
 so in his note <fullstop> this would seem to indicate that the book is one
 which he thought i would have no difficulty in finding for myself <fullstop> he
 had it--and he imagined that i would have it <comma> too <fullstop> in short <comma> watson <comma>
 it is a very common book <fullstop>
 what you say certainly sounds plausible <fullstop>
 so we have contracted our field of search to a large book <comma> printed
 in double columns and in common use <fullstop>
 the bible i cried triumphantly <fullstop>
 good <comma> watson <comma> good but not <comma> if i may say so <comma> quite good enough
 even if i accepted the compliment for myself i could hardly name any
 volume which would be less likely to lie at the elbow of one of
 moriartys associates <fullstop> besides <comma> the editions of holy writ are so
 numerous that he could hardly suppose that two copies would have the
 same pagination <fullstop> this is clearly a book which is standardized <fullstop> he
 knows for certain that his page 534 will exactly agree with my page
 534 <fullstop>
 but very few books would correspond with that <fullstop>
 exactly <fullstop> therein lies our salvation <fullstop> our search is narrowed down to
 standardized books which anyone may be supposed to possess <fullstop>
 bradshaw
 there are difficulties <comma> watson <fullstop> the vocabulary of bradshaw is
 nervous and terse <comma> but limited <fullstop> the selection of words would hardly
 lend itself to the sending of general messages <fullstop> we will eliminate
 bradshaw <fullstop> the dictionary is <comma> i fear <comma> inadmissible for the same
 reason <fullstop> what then is left <question>
 an almanac
 excellent <comma> watson i am very much mistaken if you have not touched
 the spot <fullstop> an almanac let us consider the claims of whitakers
 almanac <fullstop> it is in common use <fullstop> it has the requisite number of pages <fullstop>
 it is in double column <fullstop> though reserved in its earlier vocabulary <comma> it
 becomes <comma> if i remember right <comma> quite garrulous towards the end <fullstop> he
 picked the volume from his desk <fullstop> here is page 534 <comma> column two <comma> a
 substantial block of print dealing <comma> i perceive <comma> with the trade and
 resources of british india <fullstop> jot down the words <comma> watson number
 thirteen is mahratta <fullstop> not <comma> i fear <comma> a very auspicious beginning <fullstop>
 number one hundred and twenty-seven is government which at least
 makes sense <comma> though somewhat irrelevant to ourselves and professor
 moriarty <fullstop> now let us try again <fullstop> what does the mahratta government do <question>
 alas the next word is pigs-bristles <fullstop> we are undone <comma> my good
 watson it is finished
 he had spoken in jesting vein <comma> but the twitching of his bushy
 eyebrows bespoke his disappointment and irritation <fullstop> i sat helpless
 and unhappy <comma> staring into the fire <fullstop> a long silence was broken by a
 sudden exclamation from holmes <comma> who dashed at a cupboard <comma> from which
 he emerged with a second yellow-covered volume in his hand <fullstop>
 we pay the price <comma> watson <comma> for being too up-to-date he cried <fullstop> we
 are before our time <comma> and suffer the usual penalties <fullstop> being the
 seventh of january <comma> we have very properly laid in the new almanac <fullstop> it
 is more than likely that porlock took his message from the old one <fullstop>
 no doubt he would have told us so had his letter of explanation been
 written <fullstop> now let us see what page 534 has in store for us <fullstop> number
 thirteen is there <comma> which is much more promising <fullstop> number one hundred
 and twenty-seven is is--there is--holmess eyes were gleaming
 with excitement <comma> and his thin <comma> nervous fingers twitched as he counted
 the words--danger <fullstop> ha ha capital put that down <comma> watson <fullstop> there
 is danger-- may-- come-- very-- soon-- one <fullstop> then we have the name
 douglas --rich-- country-- now-- at-- birlstone-- house--
 birlstone-- confidence-- is-- pressing <fullstop> there <comma> watson what do you
 think of pure reason and its fruit <question> if the greengrocer had such a
 thing as a laurel wreath <comma> i should send billy round for it <fullstop>
 i was staring at the strange message which i had scrawled <comma> as he
 deciphered it <comma> upon a sheet of foolscap on my knee <fullstop>
 what a queer <comma> scrambling way of expressing his meaning said i <fullstop>
 on the contrary <comma> he has done quite remarkably well <comma> said holmes <fullstop>
 when you search a single column for words with which to express your
 meaning <comma> you can hardly expect to get everything you want <fullstop> you are
 bound to leave something to the intelligence of your correspondent <fullstop>
 the purport is perfectly clear <fullstop> some deviltry is intended against one
 douglas <comma> whoever he may be <comma> residing as stated <comma> a rich country
 gentleman <fullstop> he is sure--confidence was as near as he could get to
 confident--that it is pressing <fullstop> there is our result--and a very
 workmanlike little bit of analysis it was
 holmes had the impersonal joy of the true artist in his better work <comma>
 even as he mourned darkly when it fell below the high level to which
 he aspired <fullstop> he was still chuckling over his success when billy swung
 open the door and inspector macdonald of scotland yard was ushered
 into the room <fullstop>
 those were the early days at the end of the 80s <comma> when alec
 macdonald was far from having attained the national fame which he has
 now achieved <fullstop> he was a young but trusted member of the detective
 force <comma> who had distinguished himself in several cases which had been
 entrusted to him <fullstop> his tall <comma> bony figure gave promise of exceptional
 physical strength <comma> while his great cranium and deep-set <comma> lustrous
 eyes spoke no less clearly of the keen intelligence which twinkled
 out from behind his bushy eyebrows <fullstop> he was a silent <comma> precise man with
 a dour nature and a hard aberdonian accent <fullstop>
 twice already in his career had holmes helped him to attain success <comma>
 his own sole reward being the intellectual joy of the problem <fullstop> for
 this reason the affection and respect of the scotchman for his
 amateur colleague were profound <comma> and he showed them by the frankness
 with which he consulted holmes in every difficulty <fullstop> mediocrity knows
 nothing higher than itself but talent instantly recognizes genius <comma>
 and macdonald had talent enough for his profession to enable him to
 perceive that there was no humiliation in seeking the assistance of
 one who already stood alone in europe <comma> both in his gifts and in his
 experience <fullstop> holmes was not prone to friendship <comma> but he was tolerant
 of the big scotchman <comma> and smiled at the sight of him <fullstop>
 you are an early bird <comma> mr <fullstop> mac <comma> said he <fullstop> i wish you luck with your
 worm <fullstop> i fear this means that there is some mischief afoot <fullstop>
 if you said hope instead of fear <comma> it would be nearer the truth <comma>
 im thinking <comma> mr <fullstop> holmes <comma> the inspector answered <comma> with a knowing
 grin <fullstop> well <comma> maybe a wee nip would keep out the raw morning chill <fullstop>
 no <comma> i wont smoke <comma> i thank you <fullstop> ill have to be pushing on my way
 for the early hours of a case are the precious ones <comma> as no man knows
 better than your own self <fullstop> but--but--
 the inspector had stopped suddenly <comma> and was staring with a look of
 absolute amazement at a paper upon the table <fullstop> it was the sheet upon
 which i had scrawled the enigmatic message <fullstop>
 douglas he stammered <fullstop> birlstone whats this <comma> mr <fullstop> holmes <question> man <comma>
 its witchcraft where in the name of all that is wonderful did you
 get those names <question>
 it is a cipher that dr <fullstop> watson and i have had occasion to solve <fullstop> but
 why--whats amiss with the names <question>
 the inspector looked from one to the other of us in dazed
 astonishment <fullstop> just this <comma> said he <comma> that mr <fullstop> douglas of birlstone
 manor house was horribly murdered last night
 it was one of those dramatic moments for which my friend existed <fullstop> it
 would be an overstatement to say that he was shocked or even excited
 by the amazing announcement <fullstop> without having a tinge of cruelty in his
 singular composition <comma> he was undoubtedly callous from long
 over-stimulation <fullstop> yet <comma> if his emotions were dulled <comma> his intellectual
 perceptions were exceedingly active <fullstop> there was no trace then of the
 horror which i had myself felt at this curt declaration but his face
 showed rather the quiet and interested composure of the chemist who
 sees the crystals falling into position from his oversaturated
 solution <fullstop>
 remarkable said he <fullstop> remarkable
 you dont seem surprised <fullstop>
 interested <comma> mr <fullstop> mac <comma> but hardly surprised <fullstop> why should i be
 surprised <question> i receive an anonymous communication from a quarter which
 i know to be important <comma> warning me that danger threatens a certain
 person <fullstop> within an hour i learn that this danger has actually
 materialized and that the person is dead <fullstop> i am interested but <comma> as
 you observe <comma> i am not surprised <fullstop>
 in a few short sentences he explained to the inspector the facts
 about the letter and the cipher <fullstop> macdonald sat with his chin on his
 hands and his great sandy eyebrows bunched into a yellow tangle <fullstop>
 i was going down to birlstone this morning <comma> said he <fullstop> i had come to
 ask you if you cared to come with me--you and your friend here <fullstop> but
 from what you say we might perhaps be doing better work in london <fullstop>
 i rather think not <comma> said holmes <fullstop>
 hang it all <comma> mr <fullstop> holmes cried the inspector <fullstop> the papers will be
 full of the birlstone mystery in a day or two but wheres the
 mystery if there is a man in london who prophesied the crime before
 ever it occurred <question> we have only to lay our hands on that man <comma> and the
 rest will follow <fullstop>
 no doubt <comma> mr <fullstop> mac <fullstop> but how do you propose to lay your hands on the
 so-called porlock <question>
 macdonald turned over the letter which holmes had handed him <fullstop> posted
 in camberwell--that doesnt help us much <fullstop> name <comma> you say <comma> is assumed <fullstop>
 not much to go on <comma> certainly <fullstop> didnt you say that you have sent him
 money <question>
 twice <fullstop>
 and how <question>
 in notes to camberwell post-office <fullstop>
 did you ever trouble to see who called for them <question>
 no <fullstop>
 the inspector looked surprised and a little shocked <fullstop> why not <question>
 because i always keep faith <fullstop> i had promised when he first wrote that
 i would not try to trace him <fullstop>
 you think there is someone behind him <question>
 i know there is <fullstop>
 this professor that ive heard you mention <question>
 exactly
 inspector macdonald smiled <comma> and his eyelid quivered as he glanced
 towards me <fullstop> i wont conceal from you <comma> mr <fullstop> holmes <comma> that we think in
 the c <fullstop> i <fullstop> d <fullstop> that you have a wee bit of a bee in your bonnet over
 this professor <fullstop> i made some inquiries myself about the matter <fullstop> he
 seems to be a very respectable <comma> learned <comma> and talented sort of man <fullstop>
 im glad youve got so far as to recognize the talent <fullstop>
 man <comma> you cant but recognize it after i heard your view i made it
 my business to see him <fullstop> i had a chat with him on eclipses <fullstop> how the
 talk got that way i canna think but he had out a reflector lantern
 and a globe <comma> and made it all clear in a minute <fullstop> he lent me a book
 but i dont mind saying that it was a bit above my head <comma> though i had
 a good aberdeen upbringing <fullstop> hed have made a grand meenister with his
 thin face and gray hair and solemn-like way of talking <fullstop> when he put
 blessing before you go out into the cold <comma> cruel world <fullstop>
 holmes chuckled and rubbed his hands <fullstop> great he said <fullstop> great tell
 me <comma> friend macdonald <comma> this pleasing and touching interview was <comma> i
 suppose <comma> in the professors study <question>
 thats so <fullstop>
 a fine room <comma> is it not <question>
 very fine--very handsome indeed <comma> mr <fullstop> holmes <fullstop>
 you sat in front of his writing desk <question>
 just so <fullstop>
 sun in your eyes and his face in the shadow <question>
 well <comma> it was evening but i mind that the lamp was turned on my
 face <fullstop>
 it would be <fullstop> did you happen to observe a picture over the
 professors head <question>
 i dont miss much <comma> mr <fullstop> holmes <fullstop> maybe i learned that from you <fullstop> yes <comma> i
 saw the picture--a young woman with her head on her hands <comma> peeping at
 you sideways <fullstop>
 that painting was by jean baptiste greuze <fullstop>
 the inspector endeavoured to look interested <fullstop>
 jean baptiste greuze <comma> holmes continued <comma> joining his finger tips and
 leaning well back in his chair <comma> was a french artist who flourished
 between the years 1750 and 1800 <fullstop> i allude <comma> of course to his working
 career <fullstop> modern criticism has more than indorsed the high opinion
 formed of him by his contemporaries <fullstop>
 the inspectors eyes grew abstracted <fullstop> hadnt we better-- he said <fullstop>
 we are doing so <comma> holmes interrupted <fullstop> all that i am saying has a
 very direct and vital bearing upon what you have called the birlstone
 mystery <fullstop> in fact <comma> it may in a sense be called the very centre of it <fullstop>
 macdonald smiled feebly <comma> and looked appealingly to me <fullstop> your thoughts
 move a bit too quick for me <comma> mr <fullstop> holmes <fullstop> you leave out a link or two <comma>
 and i cant get over the gap <fullstop> what in the whole wide world can be the
 connection between this dead painting man and the affair at
 birlstone <question>
 all knowledge comes useful to the detective <comma> remarked holmes <fullstop> even
 the trivial fact that in the year 1865 a picture by greuze entitled
 la jeune fille a lagneau fetched one million two hundred thousand
 francs--more than forty thousand pounds--at the portalis sale may
 start a train of reflection in your mind <fullstop>
 it was clear that it did <fullstop> the inspector looked honestly interested <fullstop>
 i may remind you <comma> holmes continued <comma> that the professors salary
 can be ascertained in several trustworthy books of reference <fullstop> it is
 seven hundred a year <fullstop>
 then how could he buy--
 quite so how could he <question>
 ay <comma> thats remarkable <comma> said the inspector thoughtfully <fullstop> talk away <comma>
 mr <fullstop> holmes <fullstop> im just loving it <fullstop> its fine
 holmes smiled <fullstop> he was always warmed by genuine admiration--the
 characteristic of the real artist <fullstop> what about birlstone <question> he asked <fullstop>
 weve time yet <comma> said the inspector <comma> glancing at his watch <fullstop> ive a
 cab at the door <comma> and it wont take us twenty minutes to victoria <fullstop> but
 about this picture i thought you told me once <comma> mr <fullstop> holmes <comma> that you
 had never met professor moriarty <fullstop>
 no <comma> i never have <fullstop>
 then how do you know about his rooms <question>
 ah <comma> thats another matter <fullstop> i have been three times in his rooms <comma>
 twice waiting for him under different pretexts and leaving before he
 came <fullstop> once--well <comma> i can hardly tell about the once to an official
 detective <fullstop> it was on the last occasion that i took the liberty of
 running over his papers--with the most unexpected results <fullstop>
 you found something compromising <question>
 absolutely nothing <fullstop> that was what amazed me <fullstop> however <comma> you have now
 seen the point of the picture <fullstop> it shows him to be a very wealthy man <fullstop>
 how did he acquire wealth <question> he is unmarried <fullstop> his younger brother is a
 station master in the west of england <fullstop> his chair is worth seven
 hundred a year <fullstop> and he owns a greuze <fullstop>
 well <question>
 surely the inference is plain <fullstop>
 you mean that he has a great income and that he must earn it in an
 illegal fashion <question>
 exactly <fullstop> of course i have other reasons for thinking so--dozens of
 exiguous threads which lead vaguely up towards the centre of the web
 where the poisonous <comma> motionless creature is lurking <fullstop> i only mention
 the greuze because it brings the matter within the range of your own
 observation <fullstop>
 well <comma> mr <fullstop> holmes <comma> i admit that what you say is interesting its
 more than interesting--its just wonderful <fullstop> but let us have it a
 little clearer if you can <fullstop> is it forgery <comma> coining <comma> burglary--where
 does the money come from <question>
 have you ever read of jonathan wild <question>
 well <comma> the name has a familiar sound <fullstop> someone in a novel <comma> was he not <question>
 i dont take much stock of detectives in novels--chaps that do things
 and never let you see how they do them <fullstop> thats just inspiration not
 business <fullstop>
 jonathan wild wasnt a detective <comma> and he wasnt in a novel <fullstop> he was a
 master criminal <comma> and he lived last century--1750 or thereabouts <fullstop>
 then hes no use to me <fullstop> im a practical man <fullstop>
 mr <fullstop> mac <comma> the most practical thing that you ever did in your life
 would be to shut yourself up for three months and read twelve hours a
 day at the annals of crime <fullstop> everything comes in circles--even
 professor moriarty <fullstop> jonathan wild was the hidden force of the london
 criminals <comma> to whom he sold his brains and his organization on a
 fifteen per cent commission <fullstop> the old wheel turns <comma> and the same spoke
 comes up <fullstop> its all been done before <comma> and will be again <fullstop> ill tell you
 one or two things about moriarty which may interest you <fullstop>
 youll interest me <comma> right enough <fullstop>
 i happen to know who is the first link in his chain--a chain with
 this napoleon-gone-wrong at one end <comma> and a hundred broken fighting
 men <comma> pickpockets <comma> blackmailers <comma> and card sharpers at the other <comma> with
 every sort of crime in between <fullstop> his chief of staff is colonel
 sebastian moran <comma> as aloof and guarded and inaccessible to the law as
 himself <fullstop> what do you think he pays him <question>
 id like to hear <fullstop>
 six thousand a year <fullstop> thats paying for brains <comma> you see--the american
 business principle <fullstop> i learned that detail quite by chance <fullstop> its more
 than the prime minister gets <fullstop> that gives you an idea of moriartys
 gains and of the scale on which he works <fullstop> another point i made it my
 business to hunt down some of moriartys checks lately--just common
 innocent checks that he pays his household bills with <fullstop> they were
 drawn on six different banks <fullstop> does that make any impression on your
 mind <question>
 queer <comma> certainly but what do you gather from it <question>
 that he wanted no gossip about his wealth <fullstop> no single man should know
 what he had <fullstop> i have no doubt that he has twenty banking accounts the
 bulk of his fortune abroad in the deutsche bank or the credit
 lyonnais as likely as not <fullstop> sometime when you have a year or two to
 spare i commend to you the study of professor moriarty <fullstop>
 inspector macdonald had grown steadily more impressed as the
 conversation proceeded <fullstop> he had lost himself in his interest <fullstop> now his
 practical scotch intelligence brought him back with a snap to the
 matter in hand <fullstop>
 he can keep <comma> anyhow <comma> said he <fullstop> youve got us side-tracked with your
 interesting anecdotes <comma> mr <fullstop> holmes <fullstop> what really counts is your remark
 that there is some connection between the professor and the crime <fullstop>
 that you get from the warning received through the man porlock <fullstop> can
 we for our present practical needs get any further than that <question>
 we may form some conception as to the motives of the crime <fullstop> it is <comma>
 as i gather from your original remarks <comma> an inexplicable <comma> or at least
 an unexplained <comma> murder <fullstop> now <comma> presuming that the source of the crime
 is as we suspect it to be <comma> there might be two different motives <fullstop> in
 the first place <comma> i may tell you that moriarty rules with a rod of
 iron over his people <fullstop> his discipline is tremendous <fullstop> there is only one
 punishment in his code <fullstop> it is death <fullstop> now we might suppose that this
 murdered man--this douglas whose approaching fate was known by one of
 the arch-criminals subordinates--had in some way betrayed the chief <fullstop>
 his punishment followed <comma> and would be known to all--if only to put
 the fear of death into them <fullstop>
 well <comma> that is one suggestion <comma> mr <fullstop> holmes <fullstop>
 the other is that it has been engineered by moriarty in the ordinary
 course of business <fullstop> was there any robbery <question>
 i have not heard <fullstop>
 if so <comma> it would <comma> of course <comma> be against the first hypothesis and in
 favour of the second <fullstop> moriarty may have been engaged to engineer it
 manage it <fullstop> either is possible <fullstop> but whichever it may be <comma> or if it is
 some third combination <comma> it is down at birlstone that we must seek the
 solution <fullstop> i know our man too well to suppose that he has left
 anything up here which may lead us to him <fullstop>
 then to birlstone we must go cried macdonald <comma> jumping from his
 chair <fullstop> my word its later than i thought <fullstop> i can give you <comma>
 gentlemen <comma> five minutes for preparation <comma> and that is all <fullstop>
 and ample for us both <comma> said holmes <comma> as he sprang up and hastened to
 change from his dressing gown to his coat <fullstop> while we are on our way <comma>
 mr <fullstop> mac <comma> i will ask you to be good enough to tell me all about it <fullstop>
 all about it proved to be disappointingly little <comma> and yet there was
 enough to assure us that the case before us might well be worthy of
 the experts closest attention <fullstop> he brightened and rubbed his thin
 hands together as he listened to the meagre but remarkable details <fullstop> a
 long series of sterile weeks lay behind us <comma> and here at last there
 was a fitting object for those remarkable powers which <comma> like all
 special gifts <comma> become irksome to their owner when they are not in
 use <fullstop> that razor brain blunted and rusted with inaction <fullstop>
 and his whole eager face shone with an inward light when the call for
 work reached him <fullstop> leaning forward in the cab <comma> he listened intently to
 macdonalds short sketch of the problem which awaited us in sussex <fullstop>
 the inspector was himself dependent <comma> as he explained to us <comma> upon a
 scribbled account forwarded to him by the milk train in the early
 hours of the morning <fullstop> white mason <comma> the local officer <comma> was a personal
 friend <comma> and hence macdonald had been notified much more promptly than
 is usual at scotland yard when provincials need their assistance <fullstop> it
 is a very cold scent upon which the metropolitan expert is generally
 asked to run <fullstop>
 dear inspector macdonald said the letter which he read to us
 official requisition for your services is in separate envelope <fullstop> this
 is for your private eye <fullstop> wire me what train in the morning you can
 get for birlstone <comma> and i will meet it--or have it met if i am too
 occupied <fullstop> this case is a snorter <fullstop> dont waste a moment in getting
 started <fullstop> if you can bring mr <fullstop> holmes <comma> please do so for he will find
 something after his own heart <fullstop> we would think the whole thing had
 been fixed up for theatrical effect if there wasnt a dead man in the
 middle of it <fullstop> my word it is a snorter <fullstop>
 your friend seems to be no fool <comma> remarked holmes <fullstop>
 no <comma> sir <comma> white mason is a very live man <comma> if i am any judge <fullstop>
 well <comma> have you anything more <question>
 only that he will give us every detail when we meet <fullstop>
 then how did you get at mr <fullstop> douglas and the fact that he had been
 horribly murdered <question>
 that was in the enclosed official report <fullstop> it didnt say horrible
 thats not a recognized official term <fullstop> it gave the name john douglas <fullstop>
 it mentioned that his injuries had been in the head <comma> from the
 discharge of a shotgun <fullstop> it also mentioned the hour of the alarm <comma>
 which was close on to midnight last night <fullstop> it added that the case was
 undoubtedly one of murder <comma> but that no arrest had been made <comma> and that
 the case was one which presented some very perplexing and
 extraordinary features <fullstop> thats absolutely all we have at present <comma> mr <fullstop>
 holmes <fullstop>
 then <comma> with your permission <comma> we will leave it at that <comma> mr <fullstop> mac <fullstop> the
 temptation to form premature theories upon insufficient data is the
 bane of our profession <fullstop> i can see only two things for certain at
 present--a great brain in london <comma> and a dead man in sussex <fullstop> its the
 chain between that we are going to trace <fullstop>
 the tragedy of birlstone
 now for a moment i will ask leave to remove my own insignificant
 personality and to describe events which occurred before we arrived
 upon the scene by the light of knowledge which came to us afterwards <fullstop>
 only in this way can i make the reader appreciate the people
 concerned and the strange setting in which their fate was cast <fullstop>
 the village of birlstone is a small and very ancient cluster of
 half-timbered cottages on the northern border of the county of
 sussex <fullstop> for centuries it had remained unchanged but within the last
 few years its picturesque appearance and situation have attracted a
 number of well-to-do residents <comma> whose villas peep out from the woods
 around <fullstop> these woods are locally supposed to be the extreme fringe of
 the great weald forest <comma> which thins away until it reaches the
 northern chalk downs <fullstop> a number of small shops have come into being to
 meet the wants of the increased population so there seems some
 prospect that birlstone may soon grow from an ancient village into a
 modern town <fullstop> it is the centre for a considerable area of country <comma>
 since tunbridge wells <comma> the nearest place of importance <comma> is ten or
 twelve miles to the eastward <comma> over the borders of kent <fullstop>
 about half a mile from the town <comma> standing in an old park famous for
 of this venerable building dates back to the time of the first
 crusade <comma> when hugo de capus built a fortalice in the centre of the
 estate <comma> which had been granted to him by the red king <fullstop> this was
 destroyed by fire in 1543 <comma> and some of its smoke-blackened corner
 stones were used when <comma> in jacobean times <comma> a brick country house rose
 upon the ruins of the feudal castle <fullstop>
 the manor house <comma> with its many gables and its small diamond-paned
 windows <comma> was still much as the builder had left it in the early
 seventeenth century <fullstop> of the double moats which had guarded its more
 warlike predecessor <comma> the outer had been allowed to dry up <comma> and served
 the humble function of a kitchen garden <fullstop> the inner one was still
 there <comma> and lay forty feet in breadth <comma> though now only a few feet in
 depth <comma> round the whole house <fullstop> a small stream fed it and continued
 beyond it <comma> so that the sheet of water <comma> though turbid <comma> was never
 ditch-like or unhealthy <fullstop> the ground floor windows were within a foot
 of the surface of the water <fullstop>
 the only approach to the house was over a drawbridge <comma> the chains and
 windlass of which had long been rusted and broken <fullstop> the latest tenants
 of the manor house had <comma> however <comma> with characteristic energy <comma> set this
 right <comma> and the drawbridge was not only capable of being raised <comma> but
 actually was raised every evening and lowered every morning <fullstop> by thus
 renewing the custom of the old feudal days the manor house was
 converted into an island during the night--a fact which had a very
 direct bearing upon the mystery which was soon to engage the
 attention of all england <fullstop>
 the house had been untenanted for some years and was threatening to
 moulder into a picturesque decay when the douglases took possession
 of it <fullstop> this family consisted of only two individuals--john douglas
 and his wife <fullstop> douglas was a remarkable man <comma> both in character and in
 person <fullstop> in age he may have been about fifty <comma> with a strong-jawed <comma>
 rugged face <comma> a grizzling moustache <comma> peculiarly keen gray eyes <comma> and a
 wiry <comma> vigorous figure which had lost nothing of the strength and
 activity of youth <fullstop> he was cheery and genial to all <comma> but somewhat
 offhand in his manners <comma> giving the impression that he had seen life
 in social strata on some far lower horizon than the county society of
 sussex <fullstop>
 yet <comma> though looked at with some curiosity and reserve by his more
 cultivated neighbours <comma> he soon acquired a great popularity among the
 villagers <comma> subscribing handsomely to all local objects <comma> and attending
 their smoking concerts and other functions <comma> where <comma> having a
 remarkably rich tenor voice <comma> he was always ready to oblige with an
 excellent song <fullstop> he appeared to have plenty of money <comma> which was said
 to have been gained in the california gold fields <comma> and it was clear
 his life in america <fullstop>
 the good impression which had been produced by his generosity and by
 his democratic manners was increased by a reputation gained for utter
 indifference to danger <fullstop> though a wretched rider <comma> he turned out at
 every meet <comma> and took the most amazing falls in his determination to
 hold his own with the best <fullstop> when the vicarage caught fire he
 distinguished himself also by the fearlessness with which he
 reentered the building to save property <comma> after the local fire brigade
 had given it up as impossible <fullstop> thus it came about that john douglas
 of the manor house had within five years won himself quite a
 reputation in birlstone <fullstop>
 his wife <comma> too <comma> was popular with those who had made her acquaintance
 though <comma> after the english fashion <comma> the callers upon a stranger who
 settled in the county without introductions were few and far between <fullstop>
 this mattered the less to her <comma> as she was retiring by disposition <comma>
 and very much absorbed <comma> to all appearance <comma> in her husband and her
 domestic duties <fullstop> it was known that she was an english lady who had
 met mr <fullstop> douglas in london <comma> he being at that time a widower <fullstop> she was a
 beautiful woman <comma> tall <comma> dark <comma> and slender <comma> some twenty years younger
 than her husband <comma> a disparity which seemed in no wise to mar the
 contentment of their family life <fullstop>
 it was remarked sometimes <comma> however <comma> by those who knew them best <comma> that
 the confidence between the two did not appear to be complete <comma> since
 the wife was either very reticent about her husbands past life <comma> or
 else <comma> as seemed more likely <comma> was imperfectly informed about it <fullstop> it
 had also been noted and commented upon by a few observant people that
 douglas <comma> and that she would display acute uneasiness if her absent
 countryside <comma> where all gossip is welcome <comma> this weakness of the lady
 of the manor house did not pass without remark <comma> and it bulked larger
 upon peoples memory when the events arose which gave it a very
 special significance <fullstop>
 there was yet another individual whose residence under that roof was <comma>
 it is true <comma> only an intermittent one <comma> but whose presence at the time
 of the strange happenings which will now be narrated brought his name
 prominently before the public <fullstop> this was cecil james barker <comma> of hales
 lodge <comma> hampstead <fullstop>
 cecil barkers tall <comma> loose-jointed figure was a familiar one in the
 main street of birlstone village for he was a frequent and welcome
 visitor at the manor house <fullstop> he was the more noticed as being the only
 friend of the past unknown life of mr <fullstop> douglas who was ever seen in
 his new english surroundings <fullstop> barker was himself an undoubted
 englishman but by his remarks it was clear that he had first known
 douglas in america and had there lived on intimate terms with him <fullstop> he
 appeared to be a man of considerable wealth <comma> and was reputed to be a
 bachelor <fullstop>
 in age he was rather younger than douglas--forty-five at the most--a
 tall <comma> straight <comma> broad-chested fellow with a clean-shaved <comma>
 prize-fighter face <comma> thick <comma> strong <comma> black eyebrows <comma> and a pair of
 masterful black eyes which might <comma> even without the aid of his very
 capable hands <comma> clear a way for him through a hostile crowd <fullstop> he
 neither rode nor shot <comma> but spent his days in wandering round the old
 village with his pipe in his mouth <comma> or in driving with his host <comma> or
 in his absence with his hostess <comma> over the beautiful countryside <fullstop> an
 easy-going <comma> free-handed gentleman <comma> said ames <comma> the butler <fullstop> but <comma> my
 word i had rather not be the man that crossed him he was cordial
 and intimate with douglas <comma> and he was no less friendly with his
 wife--a friendship which more than once seemed to cause some
 irritation to the husband <comma> so that even the servants were able to
 perceive his annoyance <fullstop> such was the third person who was one of the
 family when the catastrophe occurred <fullstop>
 as to the other denizens of the old building <comma> it will suffice out of
 a large household to mention the prim <comma> respectable <comma> and capable ames <comma>
 and mrs <fullstop> allen <comma> a buxom and cheerful person <comma> who relieved the lady of
 some of her household cares <fullstop> the other six servants in the house bear
 no relation to the events of the night of january 6th <fullstop>
 it was at eleven forty-five that the first alarm reached the small
 local police station <comma> in charge of sergeant wilson of the sussex
 constabulary <fullstop> cecil barker <comma> much excited <comma> had rushed up to the door
 and pealed furiously upon the bell <fullstop> a terrible tragedy had occurred
 at the manor house <comma> and john douglas had been murdered <fullstop> that was the
 breathless burden of his message <fullstop> he had hurried back to the house <comma>
 followed within a few minutes by the police sergeant <comma> who arrived at
 the scene of the crime a little after twelve oclock <comma> after taking
 prompt steps to warn the county authorities that something serious
 was afoot <fullstop>
 on reaching the manor house <comma> the sergeant had found the drawbridge
 down <comma> the windows lighted up <comma> and the whole household in a state of
 wild confusion and alarm <fullstop> the white-faced servants were huddling
 together in the hall <comma> with the frightened butler wringing his hands
 in the doorway <fullstop> only cecil barker seemed to be master of himself and
 his emotions he had opened the door which was nearest to the
 entrance and he had beckoned to the sergeant to follow him <fullstop> at that
 moment there arrived dr <fullstop> wood <comma> a brisk and capable general
 practitioner from the village <fullstop> the three men entered the fatal room
 together <comma> while the horror-stricken butler followed at their heels <comma>
 closing the door behind him to shut out the terrible scene from the
 maid servants <fullstop>
 the dead man lay on his back <comma> sprawling with outstretched limbs in
 the centre of the room <fullstop> he was clad only in a pink dressing gown <comma>
 which covered his night clothes <fullstop> there were carpet slippers on his
 bare feet <fullstop> the doctor knelt beside him and held down the hand lamp
 which had stood on the table <fullstop> one glance at the victim was enough to
 show the healer that his presence could be dispensed with <fullstop> the man
 had been horribly injured <fullstop> lying across his chest was a curious
 weapon <comma> a shotgun with the barrel sawed off a foot in front of the
 triggers <fullstop> it was clear that this had been fired at close range and
 that he had received the whole charge in the face <comma> blowing his head
 almost to pieces <fullstop> the triggers had been wired together <comma> so as to make
 the simultaneous discharge more destructive <fullstop>
 the country policeman was unnerved and troubled by the tremendous
 responsibility which had come so suddenly upon him <fullstop> we will touch
 nothing until my superiors arrive <comma> he said in a hushed voice <comma>
 staring in horror at the dreadful head <fullstop>
 nothing has been touched up to now <comma> said cecil barker <fullstop> ill answer
 for that <fullstop> you see it all exactly as i found it <fullstop>
 when was that <question> the sergeant had drawn out his notebook <fullstop>
 it was just half-past eleven <fullstop> i had not begun to undress <comma> and i was
 sitting by the fire in my bedroom when i heard the report <fullstop> it was not
 very loud--it seemed to be muffled <fullstop> i rushed down--i dont suppose it
 was thirty seconds before i was in the room <fullstop>
 was the door open <question>
 yes <comma> it was open <fullstop> poor douglas was lying as you see him <fullstop> his bedroom
 candle was burning on the table <fullstop> it was i who lit the lamp some
 minutes afterward <fullstop>
 did you see no one <question>
 no <fullstop> i heard mrs <fullstop> douglas coming down the stair behind me <comma> and i
 rushed out to prevent her from seeing this dreadful sight <fullstop> mrs <fullstop>
 allen <comma> the housekeeper <comma> came and took her away <fullstop> ames had arrived <comma> and
 we ran back into the room once more <fullstop>
 but surely i have heard that the drawbridge is kept up all night <fullstop>
 yes <comma> it was up until i lowered it <fullstop>
 then how could any murderer have got away <question> it is out of the
 question mr <fullstop> douglas must have shot himself <fullstop>
 that was our first idea <fullstop> but see barker drew aside the curtain <comma>
 and showed that the long <comma> diamond-paned window was open to its full
 extent <fullstop> and look at this he held the lamp down and illuminated a
 smudge of blood like the mark of a boot-sole upon the wooden sill <fullstop>
 someone has stood there in getting out <fullstop>
 you mean that someone waded across the moat <question>
 exactly
 then if you were in the room within half a minute of the crime <comma> he
 must have been in the water at that very moment <fullstop>
 i have not a doubt of it <fullstop> i wish to heaven that i had rushed to the
 window but the curtain screened it <comma> as you can see <comma> and so it never
 occurred to me <fullstop> then i heard the step of mrs <fullstop> douglas <comma> and i could
 not let her enter the room <fullstop> it would have been too horrible <fullstop>
 horrible enough said the doctor <comma> looking at the shattered head and
 the terrible marks which surrounded it <fullstop> ive never seen such
 injuries since the birlstone railway smash <fullstop>
 but <comma> i say <comma> remarked the police sergeant <comma> whose slow <comma> bucolic
 common sense was still pondering the open window <fullstop> its all very well
 your saying that a man escaped by wading this moat <comma> but what i ask
 you is <comma> how did he ever get into the house at all if the bridge was
 up <question>
 ah <comma> thats the question <comma> said barker <fullstop>
 at what oclock was it raised <question>
 it was nearly six oclock <comma> said ames <comma> the butler <fullstop>
 ive heard <comma> said the sergeant <comma> that it was usually raised at
 sunset <fullstop> that would be nearer half-past four than six at this time of
 year <fullstop>
 mrs <fullstop> douglas had visitors to tea <comma> said ames <fullstop> i couldnt raise it
 until they went <fullstop> then i wound it up myself <fullstop>
 then it comes to this <comma> said the sergeant if anyone came from
 outside--if they did--they must have got in across the bridge before
 six and been in hiding ever since <comma> until mr <fullstop> douglas came into the
 room after eleven <fullstop>
 that is so mr <fullstop> douglas went round the house every night the last
 thing before he turned in to see that the lights were right <fullstop> that
 brought him in here <fullstop> the man was waiting and shot him <fullstop> then he got
 away through the window and left his gun behind him <fullstop> thats how i
 read it for nothing else will fit the facts <fullstop>
 the sergeant picked up a card which lay beside the dead man on the
 floor <fullstop> the initials v <fullstop> v <fullstop> and under them the number 341 were rudely
 scrawled in ink upon it <fullstop>
 whats this <question> he asked <comma> holding it up <fullstop>
 barker looked at it with curiosity <fullstop> i never noticed it before <comma> he
 said <fullstop> the murderer must have left it behind him <fullstop>
 v <fullstop> v <fullstop>--341 <fullstop> i can make no sense of that <fullstop>
 the sergeant kept turning it over in his big fingers <fullstop> whats v <fullstop> v <fullstop> <question>
 somebodys initials <comma> maybe <fullstop> what have you got there <comma> dr <fullstop> wood <question>
 it was a good-sized hammer which had been lying on the rug in front
 of the fireplace--a substantial <comma> workmanlike hammer <fullstop> cecil barker
 pointed to a box of brass-headed nails upon the mantelpiece <fullstop>
 mr <fullstop> douglas was altering the pictures yesterday <comma> he said <fullstop> i saw
 him myself <comma> standing upon that chair and fixing the big picture above
 it <fullstop> that accounts for the hammer <fullstop>
 wed best put it back on the rug where we found it <comma> said the
 sergeant <comma> scratching his puzzled head in his perplexity <fullstop> it will
 want the best brains in the force to get to the bottom of this thing <fullstop>
 it will be a london job before it is finished <fullstop> he raised the hand
 lamp and walked slowly round the room <fullstop> hullo he cried <comma> excitedly <comma>
 drawing the window curtain to one side <fullstop> what oclock were those
 curtains drawn <question>
 when the lamps were lit <comma> said the butler <fullstop> it would be shortly
 after four <fullstop>
 someone had been hiding here <comma> sure enough <fullstop> he held down the light <comma>
 and the marks of muddy boots were very visible in the corner <fullstop> im
 bound to say this bears out your theory <comma> mr <fullstop> barker <fullstop> it looks as if
 the man got into the house after four when the curtains were drawn
 and before six when the bridge was raised <fullstop> he slipped into this room <comma>
 because it was the first that he saw <fullstop> there was no other place where
 he could hide <comma> so he popped in behind this curtain <fullstop> that all seems
 clear enough <fullstop> it is likely that his main idea was to burgle the
 house but mr <fullstop> douglas chanced to come upon him <comma> so he murdered him
 and escaped <fullstop>
 thats how i read it <comma> said barker <fullstop> but <comma> i say <comma> arent we wasting
 precious time <question> couldnt we start out and scour the country before the
 fellow gets away <question>
 the sergeant considered for a moment <fullstop>
 there are no trains before six in the morning so he cant get away
 by rail <fullstop> if he goes by road with his legs all dripping <comma> its odds
 that someone will notice him <fullstop> anyhow <comma> i cant leave here myself until
 i am relieved <fullstop> but i think none of you should go until we see more
 clearly how we all stand <fullstop>
 the doctor had taken the lamp and was narrowly scrutinizing the body <fullstop>
 whats this mark <question> he asked <fullstop> could this have any connection with
 the crime <question>
 the dead mans right arm was thrust out from his dressing gown <comma> and
 exposed as high as the elbow <fullstop> about halfway up the forearm was a
 curious brown design <comma> a triangle inside a circle <comma> standing out in
 vivid relief upon the lard-coloured skin <fullstop>
 its not tattooed <comma> said the doctor <comma> peering through his glasses <fullstop> i
 never saw anything like it <fullstop> the man has been branded at some time as
 they brand cattle <fullstop> what is the meaning of this <question>
 i dont profess to know the meaning of it <comma> said cecil barker but
 i have seen the mark on douglas many times this last ten years <fullstop>
 and so have i <comma> said the butler <fullstop> many a time when the master has
 rolled up his sleeves i have noticed that very mark <fullstop> ive often
 wondered what it could be <fullstop>
 then it has nothing to do with the crime <comma> anyhow <comma> said the
 sergeant <fullstop> but its a rum thing all the same <fullstop> everything about this
 case is rum <fullstop> well <comma> what is it now <question>
 the butler had given an exclamation of astonishment and was pointing
 at the dead mans outstretched hand <fullstop>
 theyve taken his wedding ring he gasped <fullstop>
 what
 yes <comma> indeed <fullstop> master always wore his plain gold wedding ring on the
 little finger of his left hand <fullstop> that ring with the rough nugget on it
 was above it <comma> and the twisted snake ring on the third finger <fullstop> theres
 the nugget and theres the snake <comma> but the wedding ring is gone <fullstop>
 hes right <comma> said barker <fullstop>
 do you tell me <comma> said the sergeant <comma> that the wedding ring was below
 the other <question>
 always
 then the murderer <comma> or whoever it was <comma> first took off this ring you
 call the nugget ring <comma> then the wedding ring <comma> and afterwards put the
 nugget ring back again <fullstop>
 that is so
 the worthy country policeman shook his head <fullstop> seems to me the sooner
 we get london on to this case the better <comma> said he <fullstop> white mason is a
 smart man <fullstop> no local job has ever been too much for white mason <fullstop> it
 wont be long now before he is here to help us <fullstop> but i expect well
 have to look to london before we are through <fullstop> anyhow <comma> im not ashamed
 to say that it is a deal too thick for the likes of me <fullstop>
 darkness
 at three in the morning the chief sussex detective <comma> obeying the
 urgent call from sergeant wilson of birlstone <comma> arrived from
 headquarters in a light dog-cart behind a breathless trotter <fullstop> by the
 five-forty train in the morning he had sent his message to scotland
 yard <comma> and he was at the birlstone station at twelve oclock to
 welcome us <fullstop> white mason was a quiet <comma> comfortable-looking person in a
 loose tweed suit <comma> with a clean-shaved <comma> ruddy face <comma> a stoutish body <comma>
 and powerful bandy legs adorned with gaiters <comma> looking like a small
 farmer <comma> a retired gamekeeper <comma> or anything upon earth except a very
 favourable specimen of the provincial criminal officer <fullstop>
 a real downright snorter <comma> mr <fullstop> macdonald he kept repeating <fullstop> well
 have the pressmen down like flies when they understand it <fullstop> im hoping
 we will get our work done before they get poking their noses into it
 and messing up all the trails <fullstop> there has been nothing like this that
 i can remember <fullstop> there are some bits that will come home to you <comma> mr <fullstop>
 holmes <comma> or i am mistaken <fullstop> and you also <comma> dr <fullstop> watson for the medicos
 will have a word to say before we finish <fullstop> your room is at the
 westville arms <fullstop> theres no other place but i hear that it is clean
 and good <fullstop> the man will carry your bags <fullstop> this way <comma> gentlemen <comma> if you
 please <fullstop>
 he was a very bustling and genial person <comma> this sussex detective <fullstop> in
 ten minutes we had all found our quarters <fullstop> in ten more we were seated
 in the parlour of the inn and being treated to a rapid sketch of
 macdonald made an occasional note <comma> while holmes sat absorbed <comma> with
 the expression of surprised and reverent admiration with which the
 botanist surveys the rare and precious bloom <fullstop>
 remarkable he said <comma> when the story was unfolded <comma> most remarkable
 i can hardly recall any case where the features have been more
 peculiar <fullstop>
 i thought you would say so <comma> mr <fullstop> holmes <comma> said white mason in great
 delight <fullstop> were well up with the times in sussex <fullstop> ive told you now
 how matters were <comma> up to the time when i took over from sergeant
 wilson between three and four this morning <fullstop> my word i made the old
 mare go but i need not have been in such a hurry <comma> as it turned out
 for there was nothing immediate that i could do <fullstop> sergeant wilson had
 all the facts <fullstop> i checked them and considered them and maybe added a
 few of my own <fullstop>
 what were they <question> asked holmes eagerly <fullstop>
 well <comma> i first had the hammer examined <fullstop> there was dr <fullstop> wood there to
 help me <fullstop> we found no signs of violence upon it <fullstop> i was hoping that if
 mr <fullstop> douglas defended himself with the hammer <comma> he might have left his
 mark upon the murderer before he dropped it on the mat <fullstop> but there was
 no stain <fullstop>
 that <comma> of course <comma> proves nothing at all <comma> remarked inspector
 macdonald <fullstop> there has been many a hammer murder and no trace on the
 hammer <fullstop>
 quite so <fullstop> it doesnt prove it wasnt used <fullstop> but there might have been
 stains <comma> and that would have helped us <fullstop> as a matter of fact there were
 none <fullstop> then i examined the gun <fullstop> they were buckshot cartridges <comma> and <comma> as
 sergeant wilson pointed out <comma> the triggers were wired together so
 that <comma> if you pulled on the hinder one <comma> both barrels were discharged <fullstop>
 whoever fixed that up had made up his mind that he was going to take
 no chances of missing his man <fullstop> the sawed gun was not more than two
 foot long--one could carry it easily under ones coat <fullstop> there was no
 complete makers name but the printed letters p-e-n were on the
 fluting between the barrels <comma> and the rest of the name had been cut
 off by the saw <fullstop>
 a big p with a flourish above it <comma> e and n smaller <question> asked holmes <fullstop>
 exactly <fullstop>
 pennsylvania small arms company--well-known american firm <comma> said
 holmes <fullstop>
 white mason gazed at my friend as the little village practitioner
 looks at the harley street specialist who by a word can solve the
 difficulties that perplex him <fullstop>
 that is very helpful <comma> mr <fullstop> holmes <fullstop> no doubt you are right <fullstop> wonderful
 wonderful do you carry the names of all the gun makers in the world
 in your memory <question>
 holmes dismissed the subject with a wave <fullstop>
 no doubt it is an american shotgun <comma> white mason continued <fullstop> i seem
 occurred to me <fullstop> there is some evidence then <comma> that this man who
 entered the house and killed its master was an american <fullstop>
 macdonald shook his head <fullstop> man <comma> you are surely travelling overfast <comma>
 said he <fullstop> i have heard no evidence yet that any stranger was ever in
 the house at all <fullstop>
 the open window <comma> the blood on the sill <comma> the queer card <comma> the marks of
 boots in the corner <comma> the gun
 nothing there that could not have been arranged <fullstop> mr <fullstop> douglas was an
 american <comma> or had lived long in america <fullstop> so had mr <fullstop> barker <fullstop> you dont
 need to import an american from outside in order to account for
 american doings <fullstop>
 ames <comma> the butler--
 what about him <question> is he reliable <question>
 ten years with sir charles chandos--as solid as a rock <fullstop> he has been
 with douglas ever since he took the manor house five years ago <fullstop> he
 has never seen a gun of this sort in the house <fullstop>
 the gun was made to conceal <fullstop> thats why the barrels were sawed <fullstop> it
 would fit into any box <fullstop> how could he swear there was no such gun in
 the house <question>
 well <comma> anyhow <comma> he had never seen one <fullstop>
 macdonald shook his obstinate scotch head <fullstop> im not convinced yet
 that there was ever anyone in the house <comma> said he <fullstop> im asking you to
 conseedar his accent became more aberdonian as he lost himself in
 his argument im asking you to conseedar what it involves if you
 suppose that this gun was ever brought into the house <comma> and that all
 these strange things were done by a person from outside <fullstop> oh <comma> man <comma>
 its just inconceivable its clean against common sense i put it to
 you <comma> mr <fullstop> holmes <comma> judging it by what we have heard <fullstop>
 well <comma> state your case <comma> mr <fullstop> mac <comma> said holmes in his most judicial
 style <fullstop>
 the man is not a burglar <comma> supposing that he ever existed <fullstop> the ring
 business and the card point to premeditated murder for some private
 reason <fullstop> very good <fullstop> here is a man who slips into a house with the
 deliberate intention of committing murder <fullstop> he knows <comma> if he knows
 anything <comma> that he will have a deeficulty in making his escape <comma> as the
 house is surrounded with water <fullstop> what weapon would he choose <question> you
 would say the most silent in the world <fullstop> then he could hope when the
 deed was done to slip quickly from the window <comma> to wade the moat <comma> and
 to get away at his leisure <fullstop> thats understandable <fullstop> but is it
 understandable that he should go out of his way to bring with him the
 most noisy weapon he could select <comma> knowing well that it will fetch
 every human being in the house to the spot as quick as they can run <comma>
 and that it is all odds that he will be seen before he can get across
 the moat <question> is that credible <comma> mr <fullstop> holmes <question>
 well <comma> you put the case strongly <comma> my friend replied thoughtfully <fullstop>
 it certainly needs a good deal of justification <fullstop> may i ask <comma> mr <fullstop>
 white mason <comma> whether you examined the farther side of the moat at
 once to see if there were any signs of the man having climbed out
 from the water <question>
 there were no signs <comma> mr <fullstop> holmes <fullstop> but it is a stone ledge <comma> and one
 could hardly expect them <fullstop>
 no tracks or marks <question>
 none <fullstop>
 ha would there be any objection <comma> mr <fullstop> white mason <comma> to our going down
 to the house at once <question> there may possibly be some small point which
 might be suggestive <fullstop>
 i was going to propose it <comma> mr <fullstop> holmes but i thought it well to put
 you in touch with all the facts before we go <fullstop> i suppose if anything
 should strike you-- white mason looked doubtfully at the amateur <fullstop>
 i have worked with mr <fullstop> holmes before <comma> said inspector macdonald <fullstop> he
 plays the game <fullstop>
 my own idea of the game <comma> at any rate <comma> said holmes <comma> with a smile <fullstop> i
 go into a case to help the ends of justice and the work of the
 police <fullstop> if i have ever separated myself from the official force <comma> it
 is because they have first separated themselves from me <fullstop> i have no
 wish ever to score at their expense <fullstop> at the same time <comma> mr <fullstop> white
 mason <comma> i claim the right to work in my own way and give my results at
 my own time--complete rather than in stages <fullstop>
 i am sure we are honoured by your presence and to show you all we
 know <comma> said white mason cordially <fullstop> come along <comma> dr <fullstop> watson <comma> and when
 the time comes well all hope for a place in your book <fullstop>
 we walked down the quaint village street with a row of pollarded elms
 on each side of it <fullstop> just beyond were two ancient stone pillars <comma>
 weather-stained and lichen-blotched bearing upon their summits a
 shapeless something which had once been the rampant lion of capus of
 birlstone <fullstop> a short walk along the winding drive with such sward and
 oaks around it as one only sees in rural england <comma> then a sudden turn <comma>
 and the long <comma> low jacobean house of dingy <comma> liver-coloured brick lay
 before us <comma> with an old-fashioned garden of cut yews on each side of
 it <fullstop> as we approached it <comma> there was the wooden drawbridge and the
 beautiful broad moat as still and luminous as quicksilver in the
 cold <comma> winter sunshine <fullstop>
 three centuries had flowed past the old manor house <comma> centuries of
 births and of homecomings <comma> of country dances and of the meetings of
 fox hunters <fullstop> strange that now in its old age this dark business
 should have cast its shadow upon the venerable walls and yet those
 strange <comma> peaked roofs and quaint <comma> overhung gables were a fitting
 covering to grim and terrible intrigue <fullstop> as i looked at the deep-set
 windows and the long sweep of the dull-coloured <comma> water-lapped front <comma>
 i felt that no more fitting scene could be set for such a tragedy <fullstop>
 thats the window <comma> said white mason <comma> that one on the immediate
 right of the drawbridge <fullstop> its open just as it was found last night <fullstop>
 it looks rather narrow for a man to pass <fullstop>
 well <comma> it wasnt a fat man <comma> anyhow <fullstop> we dont need your deductions <comma>
 mr <fullstop> holmes <comma> to tell us that <fullstop> but you or i could squeeze through all
 right <fullstop>
 holmes walked to the edge of the moat and looked across <fullstop> then he
 examined the stone ledge and the grass border beyond it <fullstop>
 ive had a good look <comma> mr <fullstop> holmes <comma> said white mason <fullstop> there is
 nothing there <comma> no sign that anyone has landed--but why should he
 leave any sign <question>
 exactly <fullstop> why should he <question> is the water always turbid <question>
 generally about this colour <fullstop> the stream brings down the clay <fullstop>
 how deep is it <question>
 about two feet at each side and three in the middle <fullstop>
 so we can put aside all idea of the man having been drowned in
 crossing <fullstop>
 no <comma> a child could not be drowned in it <fullstop>
 we walked across the drawbridge <comma> and were admitted by a quaint <comma>
 gnarled <comma> dried-up person <comma> who was the butler <comma> ames <fullstop> the poor old
 fellow was white and quivering from the shock <fullstop> the village sergeant <comma>
 a tall <comma> formal <comma> melancholy man <comma> still held his vigil in the room of
 anything fresh <comma> sergeant wilson <question> asked white mason <fullstop>
 no <comma> sir <fullstop>
 then you can go home <fullstop> youve had enough <fullstop> we can send for you if we
 want you <fullstop> the butler had better wait outside <fullstop> tell him to warn mr <fullstop>
 cecil barker <comma> mrs <fullstop> douglas <comma> and the housekeeper that we may want a
 word with them presently <fullstop> now <comma> gentlemen <comma> perhaps you will allow me
 to give you the views i have formed first <comma> and then you will be able
 to arrive at your own <fullstop>
 he impressed me <comma> this country specialist <fullstop> he had a solid grip of fact
 and a cool <comma> clear <comma> common-sense brain <comma> which should take him some way
 in his profession <fullstop> holmes listened to him intently <comma> with no sign of
 that impatience which the official exponent too often produced <fullstop>
 is it suicide <comma> or is it murder--thats our first question <comma>
 gentlemen <comma> is it not <question> if it were suicide <comma> then we have to believe
 that this man began by taking off his wedding ring and concealing it
 that he then came down here in his dressing gown <comma> trampled mud into a
 corner behind the curtain in order to give the idea someone had
 waited for him <comma> opened the window <comma> put blood on the--
 we can surely dismiss that <comma> said macdonald <fullstop>
 so i think <fullstop> suicide is out of the question <fullstop> then a murder has been
 done <fullstop> what we have to determine is <comma> whether it was done by someone
 outside or inside the house <fullstop>
 well <comma> lets hear the argument <fullstop>
 there are considerable difficulties both ways <comma> and yet one or the
 other it must be <fullstop> we will suppose first that some person or persons
 inside the house did the crime <fullstop> they got this man down here at a time
 when everything was still and yet no one was asleep <fullstop> they then did
 the deed with the queerest and noisiest weapon in the world so as to
 tell everyone what had happened--a weapon that was never seen in the
 house before <fullstop> that does not seem a very likely start <comma> does it <question>
 no <comma> it does not <fullstop>
 well <comma> then <comma> everyone is agreed that after the alarm was given only a
 minute at the most had passed before the whole household--not mr <fullstop>
 cecil barker alone <comma> though he claims to have been the first <comma> but ames
 and all of them were on the spot <fullstop> do you tell me that in that time
 the guilty person managed to make footmarks in the corner <comma> open the
 window <comma> mark the sill with blood <comma> take the wedding ring off the dead
 mans finger <comma> and all the rest of it <question> its impossible
 you put it very clearly <comma> said holmes <fullstop> i am inclined to agree with
 you <fullstop>
 well <comma> then <comma> we are driven back to the theory that it was done by
 someone from outside <fullstop> we are still faced with some big difficulties
 but anyhow they have ceased to be impossibilities <fullstop> the man got into
 the house between four-thirty and six that is to say <comma> between dusk
 and the time when the bridge was raised <fullstop> there had been some
 visitors <comma> and the door was open so there was nothing to prevent him <fullstop>
 he may have been a common burglar <comma> or he may have had some private
 grudge against mr <fullstop> douglas <fullstop> since mr <fullstop> douglas has spent most of his
 life in america <comma> and this shotgun seems to be an american weapon <comma> it
 would seem that the private grudge is the more likely theory <fullstop> he
 slipped into this room because it was the first he came to <comma> and he
 hid behind the curtain <fullstop> there he remained until past eleven at night <fullstop>
 at that time mr <fullstop> douglas entered the room <fullstop> it was a short interview <comma>
 if there were any interview at all for mrs <fullstop> douglas declares that
 her husband had not left her more than a few minutes when she heard
 the shot <fullstop>
 the candle shows that <comma> said holmes <fullstop>
 exactly <fullstop> the candle <comma> which was a new one <comma> is not burned more than
 half an inch <fullstop> he must have placed it on the table before he was
 attacked otherwise <comma> of course <comma> it would have fallen when he fell <fullstop>
 this shows that he was not attacked the instant that he entered the
 room <fullstop> when mr <fullstop> barker arrived the candle was lit and the lamp was
 out <fullstop>
 thats all clear enough <fullstop>
 well <comma> now <comma> we can reconstruct things on those lines <fullstop> mr <fullstop> douglas
 enters the room <fullstop> he puts down the candle <fullstop> a man appears from behind
 the curtain <fullstop> he is armed with this gun <fullstop> he demands the wedding
 ring--heaven only knows why <comma> but so it must have been <fullstop> mr <fullstop> douglas
 gave it up <fullstop> then either in cold blood or in the course of a
 struggle--douglas may have gripped the hammer that was found upon the
 mat--he shot douglas in this horrible way <fullstop> he dropped his gun and
 also it would seem this queer card--v <fullstop> v <fullstop> 341 <comma> whatever that may
 mean--and he made his escape through the window and across the moat
 at the very moment when cecil barker was discovering the crime <fullstop> hows
 that <comma> mr <fullstop> holmes <question>
 very interesting <comma> but just a little unconvincing <fullstop>
 man <comma> it would be absolute nonsense if it wasnt that anything else
 is even worse cried macdonald <fullstop> somebody killed the man <comma> and
 whoever it was i could clearly prove to you that he should have done
 it some other way <fullstop> what does he mean by allowing his retreat to be
 cut off like that <question> what does he mean by using a shotgun when silence
 was his one chance of escape <question> come <comma> mr <fullstop> holmes <comma> its up to you to
 give us a lead <comma> since you say mr <fullstop> white masons theory is
 unconvincing <fullstop>
 holmes had sat intently observant during this long discussion <comma>
 missing no word that was said <comma> with his keen eyes darting to right
 and to left <comma> and his forehead wrinkled with speculation <fullstop>
 i should like a few more facts before i get so far as a theory <comma> mr <fullstop>
 mac <comma> said he <comma> kneeling down beside the body <fullstop> dear me these
 injuries are really appalling <fullstop> can we have the butler in for a
 moment <question>  <fullstop> <fullstop> <fullstop> ames <comma> i understand that you have often seen this very
 unusual mark--a branded triangle inside a circle--upon mr <fullstop> douglass
 forearm <question>
 frequently <comma> sir <fullstop>
 you never heard any speculation as to what it meant <question>
 no <comma> sir <fullstop>
 it must have caused great pain when it was inflicted <fullstop> it is
 undoubtedly a burn <fullstop> now <comma> i observe <comma> ames <comma> that there is a small piece
 of plaster at the angle of mr <fullstop> douglass jaw <fullstop> did you observe that in
 life <question>
 yes <comma> sir <comma> he cut himself in shaving yesterday morning <fullstop>
 did you ever know him to cut himself in shaving before <question>
 not for a very long time <comma> sir <fullstop>
 suggestive said holmes <fullstop> it may <comma> of course <comma> be a mere coincidence <comma>
 or it may point to some nervousness which would indicate that he had
 reason to apprehend danger <fullstop> had you noticed anything unusual in his
 conduct <comma> yesterday <comma> ames <question>
 it struck me that he was a little restless and excited <comma> sir <fullstop>
 ha the attack may not have been entirely unexpected <fullstop> we do seem to
 make a little progress <comma> do we not <question> perhaps you would rather do the
 questioning <comma> mr <fullstop> mac <question>
 no <comma> mr <fullstop> holmes <comma> its in better hands than mine <fullstop>
 well <comma> then <comma> we will pass to this card--v <fullstop> v <fullstop> 341 <fullstop> it is rough
 cardboard <fullstop> have you any of the sort in the house <question>
 i dont think so <fullstop>
 holmes walked across to the desk and dabbed a little ink from each
 bottle on to the blotting paper <fullstop> it was not printed in this room <comma>
 he said this is black ink and the other purplish <fullstop> it was done by a
 thick pen <comma> and these are fine <fullstop> no <comma> it was done elsewhere <comma> i should
 say <fullstop> can you make anything of the inscription <comma> ames <question>
 no <comma> sir <comma> nothing <fullstop>
 what do you think <comma> mr <fullstop> mac <question>
 it gives me the impression of a secret society of some sort the
 same with his badge upon the forearm <fullstop>
 thats my idea <comma> too <comma> said white mason <fullstop>
 well <comma> we can adopt it as a working hypothesis and then see how far
 our difficulties disappear <fullstop> an agent from such a society makes his
 way into the house <comma> waits for mr <fullstop> douglas <comma> blows his head nearly off
 with this weapon <comma> and escapes by wading the moat <comma> after leaving a
 card beside the dead man <comma> which will when mentioned in the papers <comma>
 tell other members of the society that vengeance has been done <fullstop> that
 all hangs together <fullstop> but why this gun <comma> of all weapons <question>
 exactly <fullstop>
 and why the missing ring <question>
 quite so <fullstop>
 and why no arrest <question> its past two now <fullstop> i take it for granted that
 since dawn every constable within forty miles has been looking out
 for a wet stranger <question>
 that is so <comma> mr <fullstop> holmes <fullstop>
 well <comma> unless he has a burrow close by or a change of clothes ready <comma>
 they can hardly miss him <fullstop> and yet they have missed him up to now
 holmes had gone to the window and was examining with his lens the
 blood mark on the sill <fullstop> it is clearly the tread of a shoe <fullstop> it is
 remarkably broad a splay-foot <comma> one would say <fullstop> curious <comma> because <comma> so
 far as one can trace any footmark in this mud-stained corner <comma> one
 would say it was a more shapely sole <fullstop> however <comma> they are certainly
 very indistinct <fullstop> whats this under the side table <question>
 mr <fullstop> douglass dumb-bells <comma> said ames <fullstop>
 dumb-bell--theres only one <fullstop> wheres the other <question>
 i dont know <comma> mr <fullstop> holmes <fullstop> there may have been only one <fullstop> i have not
 noticed them for months <fullstop>
 one dumb-bell-- holmes said seriously but his remarks were
 interrupted by a sharp knock at the door <fullstop>
 a tall <comma> sunburned <comma> capable-looking <comma> clean-shaved man looked in at us <fullstop>
 i had no difficulty in guessing that it was the cecil barker of whom
 i had heard <fullstop> his masterful eyes travelled quickly with a questioning
 glance from face to face <fullstop>
 sorry to interrupt your consultation <comma> said he <comma> but you should hear
 the latest news <fullstop>
 an arrest <question>
 no such luck <fullstop> but theyve found his bicycle <fullstop> the fellow left his
 bicycle behind him <fullstop> come and have a look <fullstop> it is within a hundred
 yards of the hall door <fullstop>
 we found three or four grooms and idlers standing in the drive
 inspecting a bicycle which had been drawn out from a clump of
 evergreens in which it had been concealed <fullstop> it was a well used
 rudge-whitworth <comma> splashed as from a considerable journey <fullstop> there was a
 saddlebag with spanner and oilcan <comma> but no clue as to the owner <fullstop>
 it would be a grand help to the police <comma> said the inspector <comma> if
 these things were numbered and registered <fullstop> but we must be thankful
 for what weve got <fullstop> if we cant find where he went to <comma> at least we
 are likely to get where he came from <fullstop> but what in the name of all
 that is wonderful made the fellow leave it behind <question> and how in the
 world has he got away without it <question> we dont seem to get a gleam of
 light in the case <comma> mr <fullstop> holmes <fullstop>
 dont we <question> my friend answered thoughtfully <fullstop> i wonder
 the people of the drama
 have you seen all you want of the study <question> asked white mason as we
 reentered the house <fullstop>
 for the time <comma> said the inspector <comma> and holmes nodded <fullstop>
 then perhaps you would now like to hear the evidence of some of the
 people in the house <fullstop> we could use the dining-room <comma> ames <fullstop> please come
 yourself first and tell us what you know <fullstop>
 the butlers account was a simple and a clear one <comma> and he gave a
 convincing impression of sincerity <fullstop> he had been engaged five years
 before <comma> when douglas first came to birlstone <fullstop> he understood that mr <fullstop>
 douglas was a rich gentleman who had made his money in america <fullstop> he
 had been a kind and considerate employer--not quite what ames was
 used to <comma> perhaps but one cant have everything <fullstop> he never saw any
 signs of apprehension in mr <fullstop> douglas on the contrary <comma> he was the
 most fearless man he had ever known <fullstop> he ordered the drawbridge to be
 pulled up every night because it was the ancient custom of the old
 house <comma> and he liked to keep the old ways up <fullstop>
 mr <fullstop> douglas seldom went to london or left the village but on the day
 before the crime he had been shopping at tunbridge wells <fullstop> he ames
 douglas that day for he had seemed impatient and irritable <comma> which
 was unusual with him <fullstop> he had not gone to bed that night but was in
 the pantry at the back of the house <comma> putting away the silver <comma> when he
 heard the bell ring violently <fullstop> he heard no shot but it was hardly
 possible he would <comma> as the pantry and kitchens were at the very back
 of the house and there were several closed doors and a long passage
 between <fullstop> the housekeeper had come out of her room <comma> attracted by the
 violent ringing of the bell <fullstop> they had gone to the front of the house
 together <fullstop>
 as they reached the bottom of the stair he had seen mrs <fullstop> douglas
 coming down it <fullstop> no <comma> she was not hurrying it did not seem to him that
 stair mr <fullstop> barker had rushed out of the study <fullstop> he had stopped mrs <fullstop>
 douglas and begged her to go back <fullstop>
 for gods sake <comma> go back to your room he cried <fullstop> poor jack is dead
 you can do nothing <fullstop> for gods sake <comma> go back
 after some persuasion upon the stairs mrs <fullstop> douglas had gone back <fullstop> she
 did not scream <fullstop> she made no outcry whatever <fullstop> mrs <fullstop> allen <comma> the
 housekeeper <comma> had taken her upstairs and stayed with her in the
 bedroom <fullstop> ames and mr <fullstop> barker had then returned to the study <comma> where
 they had found everything exactly as the police had seen it <fullstop> the
 candle was not lit at that time but the lamp was burning <fullstop> they had
 looked out of the window but the night was very dark and nothing
 could be seen or heard <fullstop> they had then rushed out into the hall <comma> where
 ames had turned the windlass which lowered the drawbridge <fullstop> mr <fullstop> barker
 had then hurried off to get the police <fullstop>
 such <comma> in its essentials <comma> was the evidence of the butler <fullstop>
 the account of mrs <fullstop> allen <comma> the housekeeper <comma> was <comma> so far as it went <comma> a
 corroboration of that of her fellow servant <fullstop> the housekeepers room
 was rather nearer to the front of the house than the pantry in which
 ames had been working <fullstop> she was preparing to go to bed when the loud
 ringing of the bell had attracted her attention <fullstop> she was a little
 hard of hearing <fullstop> perhaps that was why she had not heard the shot but
 in any case the study was a long way off <fullstop> she remembered hearing some
 sound which she imagined to be the slamming of a door <fullstop> that was a
 good deal earlier--half an hour at least before the ringing of the
 bell <fullstop> when mr <fullstop> ames ran to the front she went with him <fullstop> she saw mr <fullstop>
 barker <comma> very pale and excited <comma> come out of the study <fullstop> he intercepted
 mrs <fullstop> douglas <comma> who was coming down the stairs <fullstop> he entreated her to go
 back <comma> and she answered him <comma> but what she said could not be heard <fullstop>
 take her up stay with her he had said to mrs <fullstop> allen <fullstop>
 she had therefore taken her to the bedroom <comma> and endeavoured to soothe
 her <fullstop> she was greatly excited <comma> trembling all over <comma> but made no other
 attempt to go downstairs <fullstop> she just sat in her dressing gown by her
 bedroom fire <comma> with her head sunk in her hands <fullstop> mrs <fullstop> allen stayed with
 her most of the night <fullstop> as to the other servants <comma> they had all gone to
 bed <comma> and the alarm did not reach them until just before the police
 arrived <fullstop> they slept at the extreme back of the house <comma> and could not
 possibly have heard anything <fullstop>
 so far the housekeeper could add nothing on cross-examination save
 lamentations and expressions of amazement <fullstop>
 cecil barker succeeded mrs <fullstop> allen as a witness <fullstop> as to the occurrences
 of the night before <comma> he had very little to add to what he had already
 told the police <fullstop> personally <comma> he was convinced that the murderer had
 escaped by the window <fullstop> the bloodstain was conclusive <comma> in his opinion <comma>
 on that point <fullstop> besides <comma> as the bridge was up <comma> there was no other
 possible way of escaping <fullstop> he could not explain what had become of the
 assassin or why he had not taken his bicycle <comma> if it were indeed his <fullstop>
 he could not possibly have been drowned in the moat <comma> which was at no
 place more than three feet deep <fullstop>
 in his own mind he had a very definite theory about the murder <fullstop>
 of which he never spoke <fullstop> he had emigrated to america when he was a
 very young man <fullstop> he had prospered well <comma> and barker had first met him
 claim at a place called benito canyon <fullstop> they had done very well but
 douglas had suddenly sold out and started for england <fullstop> he was a
 widower at that time <fullstop> barker had afterwards realized his money and
 come to live in london <fullstop> thus they had renewed their friendship <fullstop>
 douglas had given him the impression that some danger was hanging
 from california <comma> and also his renting a house in so quiet a place in
 england <comma> as being connected with this peril <fullstop> he imagined that some
 secret society <comma> some implacable organization <comma> was on douglass track <comma>
 which would never rest until it killed him <fullstop> some remarks of his had
 given him this idea though he had never told him what the society
 was <comma> nor how he had come to offend it <fullstop> he could only suppose that the
 legend upon the placard had some reference to this secret society <fullstop>
 how long were you with douglas in california <question> asked inspector
 macdonald <fullstop>
 five years altogether <fullstop>
 he was a bachelor <comma> you say <question>
 a widower <fullstop>
 have you ever heard where his first wife came from <question>
 no <comma> i remember his saying that she was of german extraction <comma> and i
 have seen her portrait <fullstop> she was a very beautiful woman <fullstop> she died of
 typhoid the year before i met him <fullstop>
 i have heard him talk of chicago <fullstop> he knew that city well and had
 worked there <fullstop> i have heard him talk of the coal and iron districts <fullstop>
 he had travelled a good deal in his time <fullstop>
 was he a politician <question> had this secret society to do with politics <question>
 no <comma> he cared nothing about politics <fullstop>
 you have no reason to think it was criminal <question>
 on the contrary <comma> i never met a straighter man in my life <fullstop>
 was there anything curious about his life in california <question>
 he liked best to stay and to work at our claim in the mountains <fullstop> he
 would never go where other men were if he could help it <fullstop> thats why i
 first thought that someone was after him <fullstop> then when he left so
 suddenly for europe i made sure that it was so <fullstop> i believe that he had
 a warning of some sort <fullstop> within a week of his leaving half a dozen men
 were inquiring for him <fullstop>
 what sort of men <question>
 well <comma> they were a mighty hard-looking crowd <fullstop> they came up to the
 claim and wanted to know where he was <fullstop> i told them that he was gone
 to europe and that i did not know where to find him <fullstop> they meant him
 no good--it was easy to see that <fullstop>
 were these men americans--californians <question>
 well <comma> i dont know about californians <fullstop> they were americans <comma> all
 right <fullstop> but they were not miners <fullstop> i dont know what they were <comma> and was
 very glad to see their backs <fullstop>
 that was six years ago <question>
 nearer seven <fullstop>
 and then you were together five years in california <comma> so that this
 business dates back not less than eleven years at the least <question>
 that is so <fullstop>
 it must be a very serious feud that would be kept up with such
 earnestness for as long as that <fullstop> it would be no light thing that
 would give rise to it <fullstop>
 i think it shadowed his whole life <fullstop> it was never quite out of his
 mind <fullstop>
 but if a man had a danger hanging over him <comma> and knew what it was <comma>
 dont you think he would turn to the police for protection <question>
 maybe it was some danger that he could not be protected against <fullstop>
 theres one thing you should know <fullstop> he always went about armed <fullstop> his
 revolver was never out of his pocket <fullstop> but <comma> by bad luck <comma> he was in his
 dressing gown and had left it in the bedroom last night <fullstop> once the
 bridge was up <comma> i guess he thought he was safe <fullstop>
 i should like these dates a little clearer <comma> said macdonald <fullstop> it is
 quite six years since douglas left california <fullstop> you followed him next
 year <comma> did you not <question>
 that is so <fullstop>
 and he had been married five years <fullstop> you must have returned about the
 time of his marriage <fullstop>
 about a month before <fullstop> i was his best man <fullstop>
 did you know mrs <fullstop> douglas before her marriage <question>
 no <comma> i did not <fullstop> i had been away from england for ten years <fullstop>
 but you have seen a good deal of her since <fullstop>
 barker looked sternly at the detective <fullstop> i have seen a good deal of
 him since <comma> he answered <fullstop> if i have seen her <comma> it is because you
 cannot visit a man without knowing his wife <fullstop> if you imagine there is
 any connection--
 i imagine nothing <comma> mr <fullstop> barker <fullstop> i am bound to make every inquiry
 which can bear upon the case <fullstop> but i mean no offense <fullstop>
 some inquiries are offensive <comma> barker answered angrily <fullstop>
 its only the facts that we want <fullstop> it is in your interest and
 everyones interest that they should be cleared up <fullstop> did mr <fullstop> douglas
 entirely approve your friendship with his wife <question>
 barker grew paler <comma> and his great <comma> strong hands were clasped
 convulsively together <fullstop> you have no right to ask such questions he
 cried <fullstop> what has this to do with the matter you are investigating <question>
 i must repeat the question <fullstop>
 well <comma> i refuse to answer <fullstop>
 you can refuse to answer but you must be aware that your refusal is
 in itself an answer <comma> for you would not refuse if you had not
 something to conceal <fullstop>
 barker stood for a moment with his face set grimly and his strong
 black eyebrows drawn low in intense thought <fullstop> then he looked up with a
 smile <fullstop> well <comma> i guess you gentlemen are only doing your clear duty
 after all <comma> and i have no right to stand in the way of it <fullstop> id only
 ask you not to worry mrs <fullstop> douglas over this matter for she has
 enough upon her just now <fullstop> i may tell you that poor douglas had just
 one fault in the world <comma> and that was his jealousy <fullstop> he was fond of
 me--no man could be fonder of a friend <fullstop> and he was devoted to his
 wife <fullstop> he loved me to come here <comma> and was forever sending for me <fullstop> and
 yet if his wife and i talked together or there seemed any sympathy
 between us <comma> a kind of wave of jealousy would pass over him <comma> and he
 would be off the handle and saying the wildest things in a moment <fullstop>
 more than once ive sworn off coming for that reason <comma> and then he
 would write me such penitent <comma> imploring letters that i just had to <fullstop>
 but you can take it from me <comma> gentlemen <comma> if it was my last word <comma> that
 no man ever had a more loving <comma> faithful wife--and i can say also no
 friend could be more loyal than i
 it was spoken with fervour and feeling <comma> and yet inspector macdonald
 could not dismiss the subject <fullstop>
 you are aware <comma> said he <comma> that the dead mans wedding ring has been
 taken from his finger <question>
 so it appears <comma> said barker <fullstop>
 what do you mean by appears <question> you know it as a fact <fullstop>
 the man seemed confused and undecided <fullstop> when i said appears i meant
 that it was conceivable that he had himself taken off the ring <fullstop>
 the mere fact that the ring should be absent <comma> whoever may have
 removed it <comma> would suggest to anyones mind <comma> would it not <comma> that the
 marriage and the tragedy were connected <question>
 barker shrugged his broad shoulders <fullstop> i cant profess to say what it
 means <fullstop> he answered <fullstop> but if you mean to hint that it could reflect
 in any way upon this ladys honour--his eyes blazed for an instant <comma>
 and then with an evident effort he got a grip upon his own
 emotions--well <comma> you are on the wrong track <comma> thats all <fullstop>
 i dont know that ive anything else to ask you at present <comma> said
 macdonald <comma> coldly <fullstop>
 entered the room there was only a candle lighted on the table <comma> was
 there not <question>
 yes <comma> that was so <fullstop>
 by its light you saw that some terrible incident had occurred <question>
 exactly <fullstop>
 you at once rang for help <question>
 yes <fullstop>
 and it arrived very speedily <question>
 within a minute or so <fullstop>
 and yet when they arrived they found that the candle was out and
 that the lamp had been lighted <fullstop> that seems very remarkable <fullstop>
 again barker showed some signs of indecision <fullstop> i dont see that it
 was remarkable <comma> mr <fullstop> holmes <comma> he answered after a pause <fullstop> the candle
 threw a very bad light <fullstop> my first thought was to get a better one <fullstop> the
 lamp was on the table so i lit it <fullstop>
 and blew out the candle <question>
 exactly <fullstop>
 holmes asked no further question <comma> and barker <comma> with a deliberate look
 from one to the other of us <comma> which had <comma> as it seemed to me <comma> something
 of defiance in it <comma> turned and left the room <fullstop>
 inspector macdonald had sent up a note to the effect that he would
 wait upon mrs <fullstop> douglas in her room but she had replied that she
 would meet us in the dining room <fullstop> she entered now <comma> a tall and
 beautiful woman of thirty <comma> reserved and self-possessed to a
 remarkable degree <comma> very different from the tragic and distracted
 figure i had pictured <fullstop> it is true that her face was pale and drawn <comma>
 like that of one who has endured a great shock but her manner was
 composed <comma> and the finely moulded hand which she rested upon the edge
 of the table was as steady as my own <fullstop> her sad <comma> appealing eyes
 travelled from one to the other of us with a curiously inquisitive
 expression <fullstop> that questioning gaze transformed itself suddenly into
 abrupt speech <fullstop>
 have you found anything out yet <question> she asked <fullstop>
 was it my imagination that there was an undertone of fear rather than
 of hope in the question <question>
 we have taken every possible step <comma> mrs <fullstop> douglas <comma> said the
 inspector <fullstop> you may rest assured that nothing will be neglected <fullstop>
 spare no money <comma> she said in a dead <comma> even tone <fullstop> it is my desire
 that every possible effort should be made <fullstop>
 perhaps you can tell us something which may throw some light upon
 the matter <fullstop>
 i fear not but all i know is at your service <fullstop>
 we have heard from mr <fullstop> cecil barker that you did not actually
 see--that you were never in the room where the tragedy occurred <question>
 no <comma> he turned me back upon the stairs <fullstop> he begged me to return to my
 room <fullstop>
 quite so <fullstop> you had heard the shot <comma> and you had at once come down <fullstop>
 i put on my dressing gown and then came down <fullstop>
 how long was it after hearing the shot that you were stopped on the
 stair by mr <fullstop> barker <question>
 it may have been a couple of minutes <fullstop> it is so hard to reckon time
 at such a moment <fullstop> he implored me not to go on <fullstop> he assured me that i
 could do nothing <fullstop> then mrs <fullstop> allen <comma> the housekeeper <comma> led me upstairs
 again <fullstop> it was all like some dreadful dream <fullstop>
 can you give us any idea how long your husband had been downstairs
 before you heard the shot <question>
 no <comma> i cannot say <fullstop> he went from his dressing room <comma> and i did not hear
 him go <fullstop> he did the round of the house every night <comma> for he was nervous
 of fire <fullstop> it is the only thing that i have ever known him nervous of <fullstop>
 that is just the point which i want to come to <comma> mrs <fullstop> douglas <fullstop> you
 have known your husband only in england <comma> have you not <question>
 yes <comma> we have been married five years <fullstop>
 have you heard him speak of anything which occurred in america and
 might bring some danger upon him <question>
 mrs <fullstop> douglas thought earnestly before she answered <fullstop> yes <fullstop> she said
 at last <comma> i have always felt that there was a danger hanging over
 him <fullstop> he refused to discuss it with me <fullstop> it was not from want of
 confidence in me--there was the most complete love and confidence
 between us--but it was out of his desire to keep all alarm away from
 me <fullstop> he thought i should brood over it if i knew all <comma> and so he was
 silent <fullstop>
 how did you know it <comma> then <question>
 mrs <fullstop> douglass face lit with a quick smile <fullstop> can a husband ever carry
 about a secret all his life and a woman who loves him have no
 suspicion of it <question> i knew it by his refusal to talk about some episodes
 in his american life <fullstop> i knew it by certain precautions he took <fullstop> i
 knew it by certain words he let fall <fullstop> i knew it by the way he looked
 at unexpected strangers <fullstop> i was perfectly certain that he had some
 powerful enemies <comma> that he believed they were on his track <comma> and that
 he was always on his guard against them <fullstop> i was so sure of it that for
 years i have been terrified if ever he came home later than was
 expected <fullstop>
 might i ask <comma> asked holmes <comma> what the words were which attracted
 your attention <question>
 the valley of fear <comma> the lady answered <fullstop> that was an expression he
 has used when i questioned him <fullstop> i have been in the valley of fear <fullstop> i
 am not out of it yet <fullstop>--are we never to get out of the valley of
 fear <question> i have asked him when i have seen him more serious than usual <fullstop>
 sometimes i think that we never shall <comma> he has answered <fullstop>
 surely you asked him what he meant by the valley of fear <question>
 i did but his face would become very grave and he would shake his
 head <fullstop> it is bad enough that one of us should have been in its
 shadow <comma> he said <fullstop> please god it shall never fall upon you it was
 some real valley in which he had lived and in which something
 terrible had occurred to him <comma> of that i am certain but i can tell
 you no more <fullstop>
 and he never mentioned any names <question>
 yes <comma> he was delirious with fever once when he had his hunting
 accident three years ago <fullstop> then i remember that there was a name that
 came continually to his lips <fullstop> he spoke it with anger and a sort of
 horror <fullstop> mcginty was the name--bodymaster mcginty <fullstop> i asked him when he
 recovered who bodymaster mcginty was <comma> and whose body he was master
 of <fullstop> never of mine <comma> thank god he answered with a laugh <comma> and that
 was all i could get from him <fullstop> but there is a connection between
 bodymaster mcginty and the valley of fear <fullstop>
 there is one other point <comma> said inspector macdonald <fullstop> you met mr <fullstop>
 douglas in a boarding house in london <comma> did you not <comma> and became
 engaged to him there <question> was there any romance <comma> anything secret or
 mysterious <comma> about the wedding <question>
 there was romance <fullstop> there is always romance <fullstop> there was nothing
 mysterious <fullstop>
 he had no rival <question>
 no <comma> i was quite free <fullstop>
 you have heard <comma> no doubt <comma> that his wedding ring has been taken <fullstop> does
 that suggest anything to you <question> suppose that some enemy of his old life
 had tracked him down and committed this crime <comma> what possible reason
 could he have for taking his wedding ring <question>
 for an instant i could have sworn that the faintest shadow of a smile
 flickered over the womans lips <fullstop>
 i really cannot tell <comma> she answered <fullstop> it is certainly a most
 extraordinary thing <fullstop>
 well <comma> we will not detain you any longer <comma> and we are sorry to have
 put you to this trouble at such a time <comma> said the inspector <fullstop> there
 are some other points <comma> no doubt but we can refer to you as they
 arise <fullstop>
 she rose <comma> and i was again conscious of that quick <comma> questioning glance
 with which she had just surveyed us <fullstop> what impression has my evidence
 made upon you <question> the question might as well have been spoken <fullstop> then <comma>
 with a bow <comma> she swept from the room <fullstop>
 shes a beautiful woman--a very beautiful woman <comma> said macdonald
 thoughtfully <comma> after the door had closed behind her <fullstop> this man barker
 has certainly been down here a good deal <fullstop> he is a man who might be
 attractive to a woman <fullstop> he admits that the dead man was jealous <comma> and
 maybe he knew best himself what cause he had for jealousy <fullstop> then
 theres that wedding ring <fullstop> you cant get past that <fullstop> the man who tears
 a wedding ring off a dead mans--what do you say to it <comma> mr <fullstop> holmes <question>
 my friend had sat with his head upon his hands <comma> sunk in the deepest
 thought <fullstop> now he rose and rang the bell <fullstop> ames <comma> he said <comma> when the
 butler entered <comma> where is mr <fullstop> cecil barker now <question>
 ill see <comma> sir <fullstop>
 he came back in a moment to say that barker was in the garden <fullstop>
 can you remember <comma> ames <comma> what mr <fullstop> barker had on his feet last night
 when you joined him in the study <question>
 yes <comma> mr <fullstop> holmes <fullstop> he had a pair of bedroom slippers <fullstop> i brought him
 his boots when he went for the police <fullstop>
 where are the slippers now <question>
 they are still under the chair in the hall <fullstop>
 very good <comma> ames <fullstop> it is <comma> of course <comma> important for us to know which
 tracks may be mr <fullstop> barkers and which from outside <fullstop>
 yes <comma> sir <fullstop> i may say that i noticed that the slippers were stained
 with blood--so indeed were my own <fullstop>
 that is natural enough <comma> considering the condition of the room <fullstop> very
 good <comma> ames <fullstop> we will ring if we want you <fullstop>
 a few minutes later we were in the study <fullstop> holmes had brought with him
 the carpet slippers from the hall <fullstop> as ames had observed <comma> the soles of
 both were dark with blood <fullstop>
 strange murmured holmes <comma> as he stood in the light of the window
 and examined them minutely <fullstop> very strange indeed
 stooping with one of his quick feline pounces <comma> he placed the slipper
 upon the blood mark on the sill <fullstop> it exactly corresponded <fullstop> he smiled
 in silence at his colleagues <fullstop>
 the inspector was transfigured with excitement <fullstop> his native accent
 rattled like a stick upon railings <fullstop>
 man <comma> he cried <comma> theres not a doubt of it barker has just marked
 the window himself <fullstop> its a good deal broader than any bootmark <fullstop> i
 mind that you said it was a splay-foot <comma> and heres the explanation <fullstop>
 but whats the game <comma> mr <fullstop> holmes--whats the game <question>
 ay <comma> whats the game <question> my friend repeated thoughtfully <fullstop>
 white mason chuckled and rubbed his fat hands together in his
 professional satisfaction <fullstop> i said it was a snorter he cried <fullstop> and
 a real snorter it is
 a dawning light
 the three detectives had many matters of detail into which to
 inquire so i returned alone to our modest quarters at the village
 inn <fullstop> but before doing so i took a stroll in the curious old-world
 garden which flanked the house <fullstop> rows of very ancient yew trees cut
 into strange designs girded it round <fullstop> inside was a beautiful stretch
 of lawn with an old sundial in the middle <comma> the whole effect so
 soothing and restful that it was welcome to my somewhat jangled
 nerves <fullstop>
 in that deeply peaceful atmosphere one could forget <comma> or remember only
 as some fantastic nightmare <comma> that darkened study with the sprawling <comma>
 bloodstained figure on the floor <fullstop> and yet <comma> as i strolled round it and
 tried to steep my soul in its gentle balm <comma> a strange incident
 occurred <comma> which brought me back to the tragedy and left a sinister
 impression in my mind <fullstop>
 i have said that a decoration of yew trees circled the garden <fullstop> at the
 end farthest from the house they thickened into a continuous hedge <fullstop>
 on the other side of this hedge <comma> concealed from the eyes of anyone
 approaching from the direction of the house <comma> there was a stone seat <fullstop>
 as i approached the spot i was aware of voices <comma> some remark in the
 deep tones of a man <comma> answered by a little ripple of feminine
 laughter <fullstop>
 an instant later i had come round the end of the hedge and my eyes
 lit upon mrs <fullstop> douglas and the man barker before they were aware of my
 presence <fullstop> her appearance gave me a shock <fullstop> in the dining-room she had
 been demure and discreet <fullstop> now all pretense of grief had passed away
 from her <fullstop> her eyes shone with the joy of living <comma> and her face still
 quivered with amusement at some remark of her companion <fullstop> he sat
 forward <comma> his hands clasped and his forearms on his knees <comma> with an
 answering smile upon his bold <comma> handsome face <fullstop> in an instant--but it
 was just one instant too late--they resumed their solemn masks as my
 figure came into view <fullstop> a hurried word or two passed between them <comma> and
 then barker rose and came towards me <fullstop>
 excuse me <comma> sir <comma> said he <comma> but am i addressing dr <fullstop> watson <question>
 i bowed with a coldness which showed <comma> i dare say <comma> very plainly the
 impression which had been produced upon my mind <fullstop>
 we thought that it was probably you <comma> as your friendship with mr <fullstop>
 speaking to mrs <fullstop> douglas for one instant <question>
 i followed him with a dour face <fullstop> very clearly i could see in my
 minds eye that shattered figure on the floor <fullstop> here within a few
 hours of the tragedy were his wife and his nearest friend laughing
 together behind a bush in the garden which had been his <fullstop> i greeted
 the lady with reserve <fullstop> i had grieved with her grief in the
 dining-room <fullstop> now i met her appealing gaze with an unresponsive eye <fullstop>
 i fear that you think me callous and hard-hearted <comma> said she <fullstop>
 i shrugged my shoulders <fullstop> it is no business of mine <comma> said i <fullstop>
 perhaps some day you will do me justice <fullstop> if you only realized--
 there is no need why dr <fullstop> watson should realize <comma> said barker
 quickly <fullstop> as he has himself said <comma> it is no possible business of his <fullstop>
 exactly <comma> said i <comma> and so i will beg leave to resume my walk <fullstop>
 one moment <comma> dr <fullstop> watson <comma> cried the woman in a pleading voice <fullstop> there
 is one question which you can answer with more authority than anyone
 else in the world <comma> and it may make a very great difference to me <fullstop> you
 know mr <fullstop> holmes and his relations with the police better than anyone
 else can <fullstop> supposing that a matter were brought confidentially to his
 knowledge <comma> is it absolutely necessary that he should pass it on to
 the detectives <question>
 yes <comma> thats it <comma> said barker eagerly <fullstop> is he on his own or is he
 entirely in with them <question>
 i really dont know that i should be justified in discussing such a
 point <fullstop>
 i beg--i implore that you will <comma> dr <fullstop> watson i assure you that you
 will be helping us--helping me greatly if you will guide us on that
 point <fullstop>
 there was such a ring of sincerity in the womans voice that for the
 instant i forgot all about her levity and was moved only to do her
 will <fullstop>
 mr <fullstop> holmes is an independent investigator <comma> i said <fullstop> he is his own
 master <comma> and would act as his own judgment directed <fullstop> at the same time <comma>
 he would naturally feel loyalty towards the officials who were
 working on the same case <comma> and he would not conceal from them anything
 which would help them in bringing a criminal to justice <fullstop> beyond this
 i can say nothing <comma> and i would refer you to mr <fullstop> holmes himself if you
 wanted fuller information <fullstop>
 so saying i raised my hat and went upon my way <comma> leaving them still
 seated behind that concealing hedge <fullstop> i looked back as i rounded the
 far end of it <comma> and saw that they were still talking very earnestly
 together <comma> and <comma> as they were gazing after me <comma> it was clear that it was
 our interview that was the subject of their debate <fullstop>
 i wish none of their confidences <comma> said holmes <comma> when i reported to
 him what had occurred <fullstop> he had spent the whole afternoon at the manor
 house in consultation with his two colleagues <comma> and returned about
 five with a ravenous appetite for a high tea which i had ordered for
 him <fullstop> no confidences <comma> watson for they are mighty awkward if it comes
 to an arrest for conspiracy and murder <fullstop>
 you think it will come to that <question>
 he was in his most cheerful and debonair humour <fullstop> my dear watson <comma>
 when i have exterminated that fourth egg i shall be ready to put you
 in touch with the whole situation <fullstop> i dont say that we have fathomed
 it--far from it--but when we have traced the missing dumb-bell--
 the dumb-bell
 dear me <comma> watson <comma> is it possible that you have not penetrated the
 fact that the case hangs upon the missing dumb-bell <question> well <comma> well <comma> you
 need not be downcast for between ourselves i dont think that either
 inspector mac or the excellent local practitioner has grasped the
 overwhelming importance of this incident <fullstop> one dumb-bell <comma> watson
 consider an athlete with one dumb-bell picture to yourself the
 unilateral development <comma> the imminent danger of a spinal curvature <fullstop>
 shocking <comma> watson <comma> shocking
 he sat with his mouth full of toast and his eyes sparkling with
 mischief <comma> watching my intellectual entanglement <fullstop> the mere sight of
 his excellent appetite was an assurance of success <comma> for i had very
 clear recollections of days and nights without a thought of food <comma>
 when his baffled mind had chafed before some problem while his thin <comma>
 eager features became more attenuated with the asceticism of complete
 mental concentration <fullstop> finally he lit his pipe <comma> and sitting in the
 inglenook of the old village inn he talked slowly and at random about
 his case <comma> rather as one who thinks aloud than as one who makes a
 considered statement <fullstop>
 a lie <comma> watson--a great <comma> big <comma> thumping <comma> obtrusive <comma> uncompromising
 lie--thats what meets us on the threshold there is our starting
 point <fullstop> the whole story told by barker is a lie <fullstop> but barkers story is
 corroborated by mrs <fullstop> douglas <fullstop> therefore she is lying also <fullstop> they are
 both lying <comma> and in a conspiracy <fullstop> so now we have the clear problem <fullstop>
 why are they lying <comma> and what is the truth which they are trying so
 hard to conceal <question> let us try <comma> watson <comma> you and i <comma> if we can get behind
 the lie and reconstruct the truth <fullstop>
 how do i know that they are lying <question> because it is a clumsy
 fabrication which simply could not be true <fullstop> consider according to
 the story given to us <comma> the assassin had less than a minute after the
 murder had been committed to take that ring <comma> which was under another
 ring <comma> from the dead mans finger <comma> to replace the other ring--a thing
 which he would surely never have done--and to put that singular card
 beside his victim <fullstop> i say that this was obviously impossible <fullstop>
 you may argue--but i have too much respect for your judgment <comma>
 watson <comma> to think that you will do so--that the ring may have been
 taken before the man was killed <fullstop> the fact that the candle had been
 lit only a short time shows that there had been no lengthy interview <fullstop>
 was douglas <comma> from what we hear of his fearless character <comma> a man who
 would be likely to give up his wedding ring at such short notice <comma> or
 could we conceive of his giving it up at all <question> no <comma> no <comma> watson <comma> the
 assassin was alone with the dead man for some time with the lamp lit <fullstop>
 of that i have no doubt at all <fullstop>
 but the gunshot was apparently the cause of death <fullstop> therefore the
 shot must have been fired some time earlier than we are told <fullstop> but
 there could be no mistake about such a matter as that <fullstop> we are in the
 two people who heard the gunshot--of the man barker and of the woman
 douglas <fullstop> when on the top of this i am able to show that the blood
 mark on the windowsill was deliberately placed there by barker <comma> in
 order to give a false clue to the police <comma> you will admit that the
 case grows dark against him <fullstop>
 now we have to ask ourselves at what hour the murder actually did
 occur <fullstop> up to half-past ten the servants were moving about the house
 so it was certainly not before that time <fullstop> at a quarter to eleven they
 had all gone to their rooms with the exception of ames <comma> who was in
 the pantry <fullstop> i have been trying some experiments after you left us
 this afternoon <comma> and i find that no noise which macdonald can make in
 the study can penetrate to me in the pantry when the doors are all
 shut <fullstop>
 it is otherwise <comma> however <comma> from the housekeepers room <fullstop> it is not so
 far down the corridor <comma> and from it i could vaguely hear a voice when
 it was very loudly raised <fullstop> the sound from a shotgun is to some extent
 muffled when the discharge is at very close range <comma> as it undoubtedly
 was in this instance <fullstop> it would not be very loud <comma> and yet in the
 silence of the night it should have easily penetrated to mrs <fullstop> allens
 room <fullstop> she is <comma> as she has told us <comma> somewhat deaf but none the less
 she mentioned in her evidence that she did hear something like a door
 slamming half an hour before the alarm was given <fullstop> half an hour before
 the alarm was given would be a quarter to eleven <fullstop> i have no doubt
 that what she heard was the report of the gun <comma> and that this was the
 real instant of the murder <fullstop>
 if this is so <comma> we have now to determine what barker and mrs <fullstop>
 douglas <comma> presuming that they are not the actual murderers <comma> could have
 been doing from quarter to eleven <comma> when the sound of the shot brought
 them down <comma> until quarter past eleven <comma> when they rang the bell and
 summoned the servants <fullstop> what were they doing <comma> and why did they not
 instantly give the alarm <question> that is the question which faces us <comma> and
 when it has been answered we shall surely have gone some way to solve
 our problem <fullstop>
 i am convinced myself <comma> said i <comma> that there is an understanding
 between those two people <fullstop> she must be a heartless creature to sit
 laughing at some jest within a few hours of her husbands murder <fullstop>
 exactly <fullstop> she does not shine as a wife even in her own account of
 what occurred <fullstop> i am not a whole-souled admirer of womankind <comma> as you
 are aware <comma> watson <comma> but my experience of life has taught me that there
 are few wives <comma> having any regard for their husbands <comma> who would let
 any mans spoken word stand between them and that husbands dead
 body <fullstop> should i ever marry <comma> watson <comma> i should hope to inspire my wife
 with some feeling which would prevent her from being walked off by a
 housekeeper when my corpse was lying within a few yards of her <fullstop> it
 was badly stage-managed for even the rawest investigators must be
 struck by the absence of the usual feminine ululation <fullstop> if there had
 been nothing else <comma> this incident alone would have suggested a
 prearranged conspiracy to my mind <fullstop>
 you think then <comma> definitely <comma> that barker and mrs <fullstop> douglas are guilty
 of the murder <question>
 there is an appalling directness about your questions <comma> watson <comma> said
 holmes <comma> shaking his pipe at me <fullstop> they come at me like bullets <fullstop> if you
 put it that mrs <fullstop> douglas and barker know the truth about the murder <comma>
 and are conspiring to conceal it <comma> then i can give you a whole-souled
 answer <fullstop> i am sure they do <fullstop> but your more deadly proposition is not so
 clear <fullstop> let us for a moment consider the difficulties which stand in
 the way <fullstop>
 we will suppose that this couple are united by the bonds of a guilty
 love <comma> and that they have determined to get rid of the man who stands
 between them <fullstop> it is a large supposition for discreet inquiry among
 servants and others has failed to corroborate it in any way <fullstop> on the
 contrary <comma> there is a good deal of evidence that the douglases were
 very attached to each other <fullstop>
 that <comma> i am sure <comma> cannot he true <fullstop> said i <comma> thinking of the beautiful
 smiling face in the garden <fullstop>
 well at least they gave that impression <fullstop> however <comma> we will suppose
 that they are an extraordinarily astute couple <comma> who deceive everyone
 upon this point <comma> and conspire to murder the husband <fullstop> he happens to be
 a man over whose head some danger hangs--
 we have only their word for that <fullstop>
 holmes looked thoughtful <fullstop> i see <comma> watson <fullstop> you are sketching out a
 theory by which everything they say from the beginning is false <fullstop>
 according to your idea <comma> there was never any hidden menace <comma> or secret
 society <comma> or valley of fear <comma> or boss macsomebody <comma> or anything else <fullstop>
 well <comma> that is a good sweeping generalization <fullstop> let us see what that
 brings us to <fullstop> they invent this theory to account for the crime <fullstop> they
 then play up to the idea by leaving this bicycle in the park as proof
 of the existence of some outsider <fullstop> the stain on the windowsill
 conveys the same idea <fullstop> so does the card on the body <comma> which might have
 been prepared in the house <fullstop> that all fits into your hypothesis <comma>
 watson <fullstop> but now we come on the nasty <comma> angular <comma> uncompromising bits
 which wont slip into their places <fullstop> why a cut-off shotgun of all
 weapons--and an american one at that <question> how could they be so sure that
 the sound of it would not bring someone on to them <question> its a mere
 chance as it is that mrs <fullstop> allen did not start out to inquire for the
 slamming door <fullstop> why did your guilty couple do all this <comma> watson <question>
 i confess that i cant explain it <fullstop>
 then again <comma> if a woman and her lover conspire to murder a husband <comma>
 are they going to advertise their guilt by ostentatiously removing
 his wedding ring after his death <question> does that strike you as very
 probable <comma> watson <question>
 no <comma> it does not <fullstop>
 and once again <comma> if the thought of leaving a bicycle concealed
 outside had occurred to you <comma> would it really have seemed worth doing
 when the dullest detective would naturally say this is an obvious
 blind <comma> as the bicycle is the first thing which the fugitive needed in
 order to make his escape <fullstop>
 i can conceive of no explanation <fullstop>
 and yet there should be no combination of events for which the wit
 of man cannot conceive an explanation <fullstop> simply as a mental exercise <comma>
 without any assertion that it is true <comma> let me indicate a possible
 line of thought <fullstop> it is <comma> i admit <comma> mere imagination but how often is
 imagination the mother of truth <question>
 we will suppose that there was a guilty secret <comma> a really shameful
 secret in the life of this man douglas <fullstop> this leads to his murder by
 someone who is <comma> we will suppose <comma> an avenger <comma> someone from outside <fullstop>
 this avenger <comma> for some reason which i confess i am still at a loss to
 explain <comma> took the dead mans wedding ring <fullstop> the vendetta might
 conceivably date back to the mans first marriage <comma> and the ring be
 taken for some such reason <fullstop>
 before this avenger got away <comma> barker and the wife had reached the
 room <fullstop> the assassin convinced them that any attempt to arrest him
 would lead to the publication of some hideous scandal <fullstop> they were
 converted to this idea <comma> and preferred to let him go <fullstop> for this purpose
 they probably lowered the bridge <comma> which can be done quite
 noiselessly <comma> and then raised it again <fullstop> he made his escape <comma> and for
 some reason thought that he could do so more safely on foot than on
 the bicycle <fullstop> he therefore left his machine where it would not be
 discovered until he had got safely away <fullstop> so far we are within the
 bounds of possibility <comma> are we not <question>
 well <comma> it is possible <comma> no doubt <comma> said i <comma> with some reserve <fullstop>
 we have to remember <comma> watson <comma> that whatever occurred is certainly
 something very extraordinary <fullstop> well <comma> now <comma> to continue our
 supposititious case <comma> the couple--not necessarily a guilty
 couple--realize after the murderer is gone that they have placed
 themselves in a position in which it may be difficult for them to
 prove that they did not themselves either do the deed or connive at
 it <fullstop> they rapidly and rather clumsily met the situation <fullstop> the mark was
 put by barkers bloodstained slipper upon the window-sill to suggest
 how the fugitive got away <fullstop> they obviously were the two who must have
 heard the sound of the gun so they gave the alarm exactly as they
 would have done <comma> but a good half hour after the event <fullstop>
 and how do you propose to prove all this <question>
 well <comma> if there were an outsider <comma> he may be traced and taken <fullstop> that
 would be the most effective of all proofs <fullstop> but if not--well <comma> the
 resources of science are far from being exhausted <fullstop> i think that an
 evening alone in that study would help me much <fullstop>
 an evening alone
 i propose to go up there presently <fullstop> i have arranged it with the
 estimable ames <comma> who is by no means whole-hearted about barker <fullstop> i
 shall sit in that room and see if its atmosphere brings me
 inspiration <fullstop> im a believer in the genius loci <fullstop> you smile <comma> friend
 watson <fullstop> well <comma> we shall see <fullstop> by the way <comma> you have that big umbrella of
 yours <comma> have you not <question>
 it is here <fullstop>
 well <comma> ill borrow that if i may <fullstop>
 certainly--but what a wretched weapon if there is danger--
 nothing serious <comma> my dear watson <comma> or i should certainly ask for your
 assistance <fullstop> but ill take the umbrella <fullstop> at present i am only awaiting
 the return of our colleagues from tunbridge wells <comma> where they are at
 present engaged in trying for a likely owner to the bicycle <fullstop>
 it was nightfall before inspector macdonald and white mason came back
 from their expedition <comma> and they arrived exultant <comma> reporting a great
 advance in our investigation <fullstop>
 man <comma> ill admeet that i had my doubts if there was ever an
 outsider <comma> said macdonald <comma> but thats all past now <fullstop> weve had the
 bicycle identified <comma> and we have a description of our man so thats a
 long step on our journey <fullstop>
 it sounds to me like the beginning of the end <comma> said holmes <fullstop> im
 sure i congratulate you both with all my heart <fullstop>
 well <comma> i started from the fact that mr <fullstop> douglas had seemed disturbed
 since the day before <comma> when he had been at tunbridge wells <fullstop> it was at
 tunbridge wells then that he had become conscious of some danger <fullstop> it
 was clear <comma> therefore <comma> that if a man had come over with a bicycle it
 was from tunbridge wells that he might be expected to have come <fullstop> we
 took the bicycle over with us and showed it at the hotels <fullstop> it was
 identified at once by the manager of the eagle commercial as
 belonging to a man named hargrave <comma> who had taken a room there two
 days before <fullstop> this bicycle and a small valise were his whole
 belongings <fullstop> he had registered his name as coming from london <comma> but had
 given no address <fullstop> the valise was london made <comma> and the contents were
 british but the man himself was undoubtedly an american <fullstop>
 well <comma> well <comma> said holmes gleefully <comma> you have indeed done some solid
 work while i have been sitting spinning theories with my friend its
 a lesson in being practical <comma> mr <fullstop> mac <fullstop>
 ay <comma> its just that <comma> mr <fullstop> holmes <comma> said the inspector with
 satisfaction <fullstop>
 but this may all fit in with your theories <comma> i remarked <fullstop>
 that may or may not be <fullstop> but let us hear the end <comma> mr <fullstop> mac <fullstop> was there
 nothing to identify this man <question>
 so little that it was evident that he had carefully guarded himself
 against identification <fullstop> there were no papers or letters <comma> and no
 marking upon the clothes <fullstop> a cycle map of the county lay on his
 bedroom table <fullstop> he had left the hotel after breakfast yesterday
 morning on his bicycle <comma> and no more was heard of him until our
 inquiries <fullstop>
 thats what puzzles me <comma> mr <fullstop> holmes <comma> said white mason <fullstop> if the
 fellow did not want the hue and cry raised over him <comma> one would
 imagine that he would have returned and remained at the hotel as an
 inoffensive tourist <fullstop> as it is <comma> he must know that he will be reported
 to the police by the hotel manager and that his disappearance will be
 connected with the murder <fullstop>
 so one would imagine <fullstop> still <comma> he has been justified of his wisdom up
 to date <comma> at any rate <comma> since he has not been taken <fullstop> but his
 description--what of that <question>
 macdonald referred to his notebook <fullstop> here we have it so far as they
 stock of him but still the porter <comma> the clerk <comma> and the chambermaid
 are all agreed that this about covers the points <fullstop> he was a man about
 five foot nine in height <comma> fifty or so years of age <comma> his hair slightly
 grizzled <comma> a grayish moustache <comma> a curved nose <comma> and a face which all of
 them described as fierce and forbidding <fullstop>
 well <comma> bar the expression <comma> that might almost be a description of
 douglas himself <comma> said holmes <fullstop> he is just over fifty <comma> with grizzled
 hair and moustache <comma> and about the same height <fullstop> did you get anything
 else <question>
 he was dressed in a heavy gray suit with a reefer jacket <comma> and he
 wore a short yellow overcoat and a soft cap <fullstop>
 what about the shotgun <question>
 it is less than two feet long <fullstop> it could very well have fitted into
 his valise <fullstop> he could have carried it inside his overcoat without
 difficulty <fullstop>
 and how do you consider that all this bears upon the general case <question>
 well <comma> mr <fullstop> holmes <comma> said macdonald <comma> when we have got our man--and
 you may be sure that i had his description on the wires within five
 minutes of hearing it--we shall be better able to judge <fullstop> but <comma> even as
 it stands <comma> we have surely gone a long way <fullstop> we know that an american
 calling himself hargrave came to tunbridge wells two days ago with
 bicycle and valise <fullstop> in the latter was a sawed-off shotgun so he came
 with the deliberate purpose of crime <fullstop> yesterday morning he set off
 for this place on his bicycle <comma> with his gun concealed in his
 overcoat <fullstop> no one saw him arrive <comma> so far as we can learn but he need
 not pass through the village to reach the park gates <comma> and there are
 many cyclists upon the road <fullstop> presumably he at once concealed his
 cycle among the laurels where it was found <comma> and possibly lurked there
 himself <comma> with his eye on the house <comma> waiting for mr <fullstop> douglas to come
 out <fullstop> the shotgun is a strange weapon to use inside a house but he
 had intended to use it outside <comma> and there it has very obvious
 advantages <comma> as it would be impossible to miss with it <comma> and the sound
 of shots is so common in an english sporting neighbourhood that no
 that is all very clear <comma> said holmes <fullstop>
 well <comma> mr <fullstop> douglas did not appear <fullstop> what was he to do next <question> he left
 his bicycle and approached the house in the twilight <fullstop> he found the
 bridge down and no one about <fullstop> he took his chance <comma> intending <comma> no
 doubt <comma> to make some excuse if he met anyone <fullstop> he met no one <fullstop> he
 slipped into the first room that he saw <comma> and concealed himself behind
 the curtain <fullstop> thence he could see the drawbridge go up <comma> and he knew
 that his only escape was through the moat <fullstop> he waited until
 quarter-past eleven <comma> when mr <fullstop> douglas upon his usual nightly round
 came into the room <fullstop> he shot him and escaped <comma> as arranged <fullstop> he was
 aware that the bicycle would be described by the hotel people and be
 a clue against him so he left it there and made his way by some
 other means to london or to some safe hiding place which he had
 already arranged <fullstop> how is that <comma> mr <fullstop> holmes <question>
 well <comma> mr <fullstop> mac <comma> it is very good and very clear so far as it goes <fullstop>
 that is your end of the story <fullstop> my end is that the crime was committed
 half an hour earlier than reported that mrs <fullstop> douglas and barker are
 both in a conspiracy to conceal something that they aided the
 murderers escape--or at least that they reached the room before he
 escaped--and that they fabricated evidence of his escape through the
 window <comma> whereas in all probability they had themselves let him go by
 lowering the bridge <fullstop> thats my reading of the first half <fullstop>
 the two detectives shook their heads <fullstop>
 well <comma> mr <fullstop> holmes <comma> if this is true <comma> we only tumble out of one mystery
 into another <comma> said the london inspector <fullstop>
 and in some ways a worse one <comma> added white mason <fullstop> the lady has
 never been in america in all her life <fullstop> what possible connection could
 she have with an american assassin which would cause her to shelter
 him <question>
 i freely admit the difficulties <comma> said holmes <fullstop> i propose to make a
 little investigation of my own to-night <comma> and it is just possible that
 it may contribute something to the common cause <fullstop>
 can we help you <comma> mr <fullstop> holmes <question>
 no <comma> no darkness and dr <fullstop> watsons umbrella--my wants are simple <fullstop> and
 ames <comma> the faithful ames <comma> no doubt he will stretch a point for me <fullstop> all
 my lines of thought lead me back invariably to the one basic
 question--why should an athletic man develop his frame upon so
 unnatural an instrument as a single dumb-bell <question>
 it was late that night when holmes returned from his solitary
 excursion <fullstop> we slept in a double-bedded room <comma> which was the best that
 the little country inn could do for us <fullstop> i was already asleep when i
 well <comma> holmes <comma> i murmured <comma> have you found anything out <question>
 he stood beside me in silence <comma> his candle in his hand <fullstop> then the tall <comma>
 lean figure inclined towards me <fullstop> i say <comma> watson <comma> he whispered <comma>
 would you be afraid to sleep in the same room with a lunatic <comma> a man
 with softening of the brain <comma> an idiot whose mind has lost its grip <question>
 not in the least <comma> i answered in astonishment <fullstop>
 ah <comma> thats lucky <comma> he said <comma> and not another word would he utter that
 night <fullstop>
 the solution
 next morning <comma> after breakfast <comma> we found inspector macdonald and white
 mason seated in close consultation in the small parlour of the local
 police sergeant <fullstop> on the table in front of them were piled a number of
 letters and telegrams <comma> which they were carefully sorting and
 docketing <fullstop> three had been placed on one side <fullstop>
 still on the track of the elusive bicyclist <question> holmes asked
 cheerfully <fullstop> what is the latest news of the ruffian <question>
 macdonald pointed ruefully to his heap of correspondence <fullstop>
 he is at present reported from leicester <comma> nottingham <comma> southampton <comma>
 derby <comma> east ham <comma> richmond <comma> and fourteen other places <fullstop> in three of
 them--east ham <comma> leicester <comma> and liverpool--there is a clear case
 against him <comma> and he has actually been arrested <fullstop> the country seems to
 be full of the fugitives with yellow coats <fullstop>
 dear me said holmes sympathetically <fullstop> now <comma> mr <fullstop> mac and you <comma> mr <fullstop>
 white mason <comma> i wish to give you a very earnest piece of advice <fullstop> when
 i went into this case with you i bargained <comma> as you will no doubt
 remember <comma> that i should not present you with half-proved theories <comma>
 but that i should retain and work out my own ideas until i had
 satisfied myself that they were correct <fullstop> for this reason i am not at
 the present moment telling you all that is in my mind <fullstop> on the other
 hand <comma> i said that i would play the game fairly by you <comma> and i do not
 think it is a fair game to allow you for one unnecessary moment to
 waste your energies upon a profitless task <fullstop> therefore i am here to
 advise you this morning <comma> and my advice to you is summed up in three
 words--abandon the case <fullstop>
 macdonald and white mason stared in amazement at their celebrated
 colleague <fullstop>
 you consider it hopeless cried the inspector <fullstop>
 i consider your case to be hopeless <fullstop> i do not consider that it is
 hopeless to arrive at the truth <fullstop>
 but this cyclist <fullstop> he is not an invention <fullstop> we have his description <comma>
 his valise <comma> his bicycle <fullstop> the fellow must be somewhere <fullstop> why should we
 not get him <question>
 yes <comma> yes <comma> no doubt he is somewhere <comma> and no doubt we shall get him
 but i would not have you waste your energies in east ham or
 liverpool <fullstop> i am sure that we can find some shorter cut to a result <fullstop>
 you are holding something back <fullstop> its hardly fair of you <comma> mr <fullstop>
 holmes <fullstop> the inspector was annoyed <fullstop>
 you know my methods of work <comma> mr <fullstop> mac <fullstop> but i will hold it back for
 the shortest time possible <fullstop> i only wish to verify my details in one
 way <comma> which can very readily be done <comma> and then i make my bow and
 return to london <comma> leaving my results entirely at your service <fullstop> i owe
 you too much to act otherwise for in all my experience i cannot
 recall any more singular and interesting study <fullstop>
 this is clean beyond me <comma> mr <fullstop> holmes <fullstop> we saw you when we returned
 from tunbridge wells last night <comma> and you were in general agreement
 with our results <fullstop> what has happened since then to give you a
 completely new idea of the case <question>
 well <comma> since you ask me <comma> i spent <comma> as i told you that i would <comma> some
 hours last night at the manor house <fullstop>
 well <comma> what happened <question>
 ah <comma> i can only give you a very general answer to that for the
 moment <fullstop> by the way <comma> i have been reading a short but clear and
 interesting account of the old building <comma> purchasable at the modest
 sum of one penny from the local tobacconist <fullstop>
 here holmes drew a small tract <comma> embellished with a rude engraving of
 the ancient manor house <comma> from his waistcoat pocket <fullstop>
 it immensely adds to the zest of an investigation <comma> my dear mr <fullstop> mac <comma>
 when one is in conscious sympathy with the historical atmosphere of
 ones surroundings <fullstop> dont look so impatient for i assure you that
 even so bald an account as this raises some sort of picture of the
 past in ones mind <fullstop> permit me to give you a sample <fullstop> erected in the
 fifth year of the reign of james i <comma> and standing upon the site of a
 much older building <comma> the manor house of birlstone presents one of the
 finest surviving examples of the moated jacobean residence-- 
 you are making fools of us <comma> mr <fullstop> holmes
 tut <comma> tut <comma> mr <fullstop> mac--the first sign of temper i have detected in you <fullstop>
 well <comma> i wont read it verbatim <comma> since you feel so strongly upon the
 subject <fullstop> but when i tell you that there is some account of the taking
 of the place by a parliamentary colonel in 1644 <comma> of the concealment
 of charles for several days in the course of the civil war <comma> and
 finally of a visit there by the second george <comma> you will admit that
 there are various associations of interest connected with this
 ancient house <fullstop>
 i dont doubt it <comma> mr <fullstop> holmes but that is no business of ours <fullstop>
 is it not <question> is it not <question> breadth of view <comma> my dear mr <fullstop> mac <comma> is one of
 the essentials of our profession <fullstop> the interplay of ideas and the
 oblique uses of knowledge are often of extraordinary interest <fullstop> you
 will excuse these remarks from one who <comma> though a mere connoisseur of
 crime <comma> is still rather older and perhaps more experienced than
 yourself <fullstop>
 im the first to admit that <comma> said the detective heartily <fullstop> you get
 to your point <comma> i admit but you have such a deuced round-the-corner
 way of doing it <fullstop>
 well <comma> well <comma> ill drop past history and get down to present-day
 facts <fullstop> i called last night <comma> as i have already said <comma> at the manor
 house <fullstop> i did not see either barker or mrs <fullstop> douglas <fullstop> i saw no
 necessity to disturb them but i was pleased to hear that the lady
 dinner <fullstop> my visit was specially made to the good mr <fullstop> ames <comma> with whom i
 exchanged some amiabilities <comma> which culminated in his allowing me <comma>
 without reference to anyone else <comma> to sit alone for a time in the
 study <fullstop>
 what with that <question> i ejaculated <fullstop>
 no <comma> no <comma> everything is now in order <fullstop> you gave permission for that <comma>
 mr <fullstop> mac <comma> as i am informed <fullstop> the room was in its normal state <comma> and in
 it i passed an instructive quarter of an hour <fullstop>
 what were you doing <question>
 well <comma> not to make a mystery of so simple a matter <comma> i was looking for
 the missing dumb-bell <fullstop> it has always bulked rather large in my
 estimate of the case <fullstop> i ended by finding it <fullstop>
 where <question>
 ah <comma> there we come to the edge of the unexplored <fullstop> let me go a little
 further <comma> a very little further <comma> and i will promise that you shall
 share everything that i know <fullstop>
 well <comma> were bound to take you on your own terms <comma> said the
 inspector but when it comes to telling us to abandon the case--why
 in the name of goodness should we abandon the case <question>
 for the simple reason <comma> my dear mr <fullstop> mac <comma> that you have not got the
 first idea what it is that you are investigating <fullstop>
 we are investigating the murder of mr <fullstop> john douglas of birlstone
 manor <fullstop>
 yes <comma> yes <comma> so you are <fullstop> but dont trouble to trace the mysterious
 gentleman upon the bicycle <fullstop> i assure you that it wont help you <fullstop>
 then what do you suggest that we do <question>
 i will tell you exactly what to do <comma> if you will do it <fullstop>
 well <comma> im bound to say ive always found you had reason behind all
 your queer ways <fullstop> ill do what you advise <fullstop>
 and you <comma> mr <fullstop> white mason <question>
 the country detective looked helplessly from one to the other <fullstop> holmes
 and his methods were new to him <fullstop> well <comma> if it is good enough for the
 inspector <comma> it is good enough for me <comma> he said at last <fullstop>
 capital said holmes <fullstop> well <comma> then <comma> i should recommend a nice <comma>
 cheery country walk for both of you <fullstop> they tell me that the views from
 birlstone ridge over the weald are very remarkable <fullstop> no doubt lunch
 could be got at some suitable hostelry though my ignorance of the
 country prevents me from recommending one <fullstop> in the evening <comma> tired but
 happy--
 man <comma> this is getting past a joke cried macdonald <comma> rising angrily
 from his chair <fullstop>
 well <comma> well <comma> spend the day as you like <comma> said holmes <comma> patting him
 cheerfully upon the shoulder <fullstop> do what you like and go where you
 will <comma> but meet me here before dusk without fail--without fail <comma> mr <fullstop>
 mac <fullstop>
 that sounds more like sanity <fullstop>
 all of it was excellent advice but i dont insist <comma> so long as you
 write a note to mr <fullstop> barker <fullstop>
 well <question>
 ill dictate it <comma> if you like <fullstop> ready <question>
 dear sir
 it has struck me that it is our duty to drain the moat <comma> in the hope
 that we may find some--
 its impossible <comma> said the inspector <fullstop> ive made inquiry <fullstop>
 tut <comma> tut my dear sir <comma> please do what i ask you <fullstop>
 well <comma> go on <fullstop>
 --in the hope that we may find something which may bear upon our
 investigation <fullstop> i have made arrangements <comma> and the workmen will be at
 work early to-morrow morning diverting the stream--
 impossible
 --diverting the stream so i thought it best to explain matters
 beforehand <fullstop>
 now sign that <comma> and send it by hand about four oclock <fullstop> at that hour
 we shall meet again in this room <fullstop> until then we may each do what we
 like for i can assure you that this inquiry has come to a definite
 pause <fullstop>
 evening was drawing in when we reassembled <fullstop> holmes was very serious
 in his manner <comma> myself curious <comma> and the detectives obviously critical
 and annoyed <fullstop>
 well <comma> gentlemen <comma> said my friend gravely <comma> i am asking you now to
 put everything to the test with me <comma> and you will judge for yourselves
 whether the observations i have made justify the conclusions to which
 i have come <fullstop> it is a chill evening <comma> and i do not know how long our
 expedition may last so i beg that you will wear your warmest coats <fullstop>
 it is of the first importance that we should be in our places before
 it grows dark so with your permission we shall get started at once <fullstop>
 we passed along the outer bounds of the manor house park until we
 came to a place where there was a gap in the rails which fenced it <fullstop>
 through this we slipped <comma> and then in the gathering gloom we followed
 holmes until we had reached a shrubbery which lies nearly opposite to
 the main door and the drawbridge <fullstop> the latter had not been raised <fullstop>
 holmes crouched down behind the screen of laurels <comma> and we all three
 followed his example <fullstop>
 well <comma> what are we to do now <question> asked macdonald with some gruffness <fullstop>
 possess our souls in patience and make as little noise as possible <comma>
 holmes answered <fullstop>
 what are we here for at all <question> i really think that you might treat us
 with more frankness <fullstop>
 holmes laughed <fullstop> watson insists that i am the dramatist in real
 life <comma> said he <fullstop> some touch of the artist wells up within me <comma> and
 calls insistently for a well-staged performance <fullstop> surely our
 profession <comma> mr <fullstop> mac <comma> would be a drab and sordid one if we did not
 sometimes set the scene so as to glorify our results <fullstop> the blunt
 accusation <comma> the brutal tap upon the shoulder--what can one make of
 such a dnouement <question> but the quick inference <comma> the subtle trap <comma> the
 clever forecast of coming events <comma> the triumphant vindication of bold
 theories--are these not the pride and the justification of our lifes
 work <question> at the present moment you thrill with the glamour of the
 situation and the anticipation of the hunt <fullstop> where would be that
 thrill if i had been as definite as a timetable <question> i only ask a little
 patience <comma> mr <fullstop> mac <comma> and all will be clear to you <fullstop>
 well <comma> i hope the pride and justification and the rest of it will
 come before we all get our death of cold <comma> said the london detective
 with comic resignation <fullstop>
 we all had good reason to join in the aspiration for our vigil was a
 long and bitter one <fullstop> slowly the shadows darkened over the long <comma>
 sombre face of the old house <fullstop> a cold <comma> damp reek from the moat chilled
 us to the bones and set our teeth chattering <fullstop> there was a single lamp
 over the gateway and a steady globe of light in the fatal study <fullstop>
 everything else was dark and still <fullstop>
 how long is this to last <question> asked the inspector finally <fullstop> and what is
 it we are watching for <question>
 i have no more notion than you how long it is to last <comma> holmes
 answered with some asperity <fullstop> if criminals would always schedule
 their movements like railway trains <comma> it would certainly be more
 convenient for all of us <fullstop> as to what it is we--well <comma> thats what we
 are watching for
 as he spoke the bright <comma> yellow light in the study was obscured by
 somebody passing to and fro before it <fullstop> the laurels among which we lay
 were immediately opposite the window and not more than a hundred feet
 from it <fullstop> presently it was thrown open with a whining of hinges <comma> and
 we could dimly see the dark outline of a mans head and shoulders
 looking out into the gloom <fullstop> for some minutes he peered forth in
 furtive <comma> stealthy fashion <comma> as one who wishes to be assured that he is
 unobserved <fullstop> then he leaned forward <comma> and in the intense silence we
 were aware of the soft lapping of agitated water <fullstop> he seemed to be
 stirring up the moat with something which he held in his hand <fullstop> then
 suddenly he hauled something in as a fisherman lands a fish--some
 large <comma> round object which obscured the light as it was dragged
 through the open casement <fullstop>
 now cried holmes <fullstop> now
 we were all upon our feet <comma> staggering after him with our stiffened
 limbs <comma> while he ran swiftly across the bridge and rang violently at
 the bell <fullstop> there was the rasping of bolts from the other side <comma> and the
 amazed ames stood in the entrance <fullstop> holmes brushed him aside without a
 word and <comma> followed by all of us <comma> rushed into the room which had been
 occupied by the man whom we had been watching <fullstop>
 the oil lamp on the table represented the glow which we had seen from
 outside <fullstop> it was now in the hand of cecil barker <comma> who held it towards
 us as we entered <fullstop> its light shone upon his strong <comma> resolute <comma>
 clean-shaved face and his menacing eyes <fullstop>
 what the devil is the meaning of all this <question> he cried <fullstop> what are you
 after <comma> anyhow <question>
 holmes took a swift glance round <comma> and then pounced upon a sodden
 bundle tied together with cord which lay where it had been thrust
 under the writing table <fullstop>
 this is what we are after <comma> mr <fullstop> barker--this bundle <comma> weighted with a
 dumb-bell <comma> which you have just raised from the bottom of the moat <fullstop>
 barker stared at holmes with amazement in his face <fullstop> how in thunder
 came you to know anything about it <question> he asked <fullstop>
 simply that i put it there <fullstop>
 you put it there you
 perhaps i should have said replaced it there <comma> said holmes <fullstop> you
 will remember <comma> inspector macdonald <comma> that i was somewhat struck by the
 absence of a dumb-bell <fullstop> i drew your attention to it but with the
 pressure of other events you had hardly the time to give it the
 consideration which would have enabled you to draw deductions from
 it <fullstop> when water is near and a weight is missing it is not a very
 far-fetched supposition that something has been sunk in the water <fullstop>
 the idea was at least worth testing so with the help of ames <comma> who
 admitted me to the room <comma> and the crook of dr <fullstop> watsons umbrella <comma> i
 was able last night to fish up and inspect this bundle <fullstop>
 it was of the first importance <comma> however <comma> that we should be able to
 prove who placed it there <fullstop> this we accomplished by the very obvious
 device of announcing that the moat would be dried to-morrow <comma> which
 had <comma> of course <comma> the effect that whoever had hidden the bundle would
 most certainly withdraw it the moment that darkness enabled him to do
 so <fullstop> we have no less than four witnesses as to who it was who took
 advantage of the opportunity <comma> and so <comma> mr <fullstop> barker <comma> i think the word
 lies now with you <fullstop>
 and undid the cord which bound it <fullstop> from within he extracted a
 dumb-bell <comma> which he tossed down to its fellow in the corner <fullstop> next he
 drew forth a pair of boots <fullstop> american <comma> as you perceive <comma> he remarked <comma>
 pointing to the toes <fullstop> then he laid upon the table a long <comma> deadly <comma>
 sheathed knife <fullstop> finally he unravelled a bundle of clothing <comma>
 comprising a complete set of underclothes <comma> socks <comma> a gray tweed suit <comma>
 and a short yellow overcoat <fullstop>
 the clothes are commonplace <comma> remarked holmes <comma> save only the
 overcoat <comma> which is full of suggestive touches <fullstop> he held it tenderly
 towards the light <fullstop> here <comma> as you perceive <comma> is the inner pocket
 prolonged into the lining in such fashion as to give ample space for
 the truncated fowling piece <fullstop> the tailors tab is on the neck--neal <comma>
 outfitter <comma> vermissa <comma> u <fullstop> s <fullstop> a <fullstop> i have spent an instructive afternoon
 in the rectors library <comma> and have enlarged my knowledge by adding the
 fact that vermissa is a flourishing little town at the head of one of
 the best known coal and iron valleys in the united states <fullstop> i have
 some recollection <comma> mr <fullstop> barker <comma> that you associated the coal districts
 with mr <fullstop> douglass first wife <comma> and it would surely not be too
 far-fetched an inference that the v <fullstop> v <fullstop> upon the card by the dead
 body might stand for vermissa valley <comma> or that this very valley which
 sends forth emissaries of murder may be that valley of fear of which
 we have heard <fullstop> so much is fairly clear <fullstop> and now <comma> mr <fullstop> barker <comma> i seem
 to be standing rather in the way of your explanation <fullstop>
 it was a sight to see cecil barkers expressive face during this
 exposition of the great detective <fullstop> anger <comma> amazement <comma> consternation <comma>
 and indecision swept over it in turn <fullstop> finally he took refuge in a
 somewhat acrid irony <fullstop>
 you know such a lot <comma> mr <fullstop> holmes <comma> perhaps you had better tell us some
 more <comma> he sneered <fullstop>
 i have no doubt that i could tell you a great deal more <comma> mr <fullstop> barker
 but it would come with a better grace from you <fullstop>
 oh <comma> you think so <comma> do you <question> well <comma> all i can say is that if theres any
 secret here it is not my secret <comma> and i am not the man to give it
 away <fullstop>
 well <comma> if you take that line <comma> mr <fullstop> barker <comma> said the inspector
 quietly <comma> we must just keep you in sight until we have the warrant
 and can hold you <fullstop>
 you can do what you damn please about that <comma> said barker defiantly <fullstop>
 the proceedings seemed to have come to a definite end so far as he
 was concerned for one had only to look at that granite face to
 realize that no peine forte et dure would ever force him to plead
 against his will <fullstop> the deadlock was broken <comma> however <comma> by a womans
 voice <fullstop> mrs <fullstop> douglas had been standing listening at the half opened
 door <comma> and now she entered the room <fullstop>
 you have done enough for now <comma> cecil <comma> said she <fullstop> whatever comes of
 it in the future <comma> you have done enough <fullstop>
 have every sympathy with you <comma> madam <comma> and should strongly urge you to
 have some confidence in the common sense of our jurisdiction and to
 take the police voluntarily into your complete confidence <fullstop> it may be
 that i am myself at fault for not following up the hint which you
 conveyed to me through my friend <comma> dr <fullstop> watson but <comma> at that time i had
 every reason to believe that you were directly concerned in the
 crime <fullstop> now i am assured that this is not so <fullstop> at the same time <comma> there
 is much that is unexplained <comma> and i should strongly recommend that you
 ask mr <fullstop> douglas to tell us his own story <fullstop>
 mrs <fullstop> douglas gave a cry of astonishment at holmess words <fullstop> the
 detectives and i must have echoed it <comma> when we were aware of a man who
 seemed to have emerged from the wall <comma> who advanced now from the gloom
 of the corner in which he had appeared <fullstop> mrs <fullstop> douglas turned <comma> and in
 an instant her arms were round him <fullstop> barker had seized his
 outstretched hand <fullstop>
 its best this way <comma> jack <comma> his wife repeated i am sure that it is
 best <fullstop>
 will find it best <fullstop>
 the man stood blinking at us with the dazed look of one who comes
 from the dark into the light <fullstop> it was a remarkable face <comma> bold gray
 eyes <comma> a strong <comma> short-clipped <comma> grizzled moustache <comma> a square <comma>
 projecting chin <comma> and a humorous mouth <fullstop> he took a good look at us all <comma>
 and then to my amazement he advanced to me and handed me a bundle of
 paper <fullstop>
 ive heard of you <comma> said he in a voice which was not quite english
 and not quite american <comma> but was altogether mellow and pleasing <fullstop> you
 are the historian of this bunch <fullstop> well <comma> dr <fullstop> watson <comma> youve never had
 such a story as that pass through your hands before <comma> and ill lay my
 last dollar on that <fullstop> tell it your own way but there are the facts <comma>
 and you cant miss the public so long as you have those <fullstop> ive been
 cooped up two days <comma> and ive spent the daylight hours--as much
 daylight as i could get in that rat trap--in putting the thing into
 words <fullstop> youre welcome to them--you and your public <fullstop> theres the story
 of the valley of fear <fullstop>
 we desire now is to hear your story of the present <fullstop>
 youll have it <comma> sir <comma> said douglas <fullstop> may i smoke as i talk <question> well <comma>
 thank you <comma> mr <fullstop> holmes <fullstop> youre a smoker yourself <comma> if i remember right <comma>
 and youll guess what it is to be sitting for two days with tobacco
 in your pocket and afraid that the smell will give you away <fullstop> he
 leaned against the mantelpiece and sucked at the cigar which holmes
 had handed him <fullstop> ive heard of you <comma> mr <fullstop> holmes <fullstop> i never guessed that
 i should meet you <fullstop> but before you are through with that <comma> he nodded
 at my papers <comma> you will say ive brought you something fresh <fullstop>
 inspector macdonald had been staring at the newcomer with the
 greatest amazement <fullstop> well <comma> this fairly beats me he cried at last <fullstop>
 if you are mr <fullstop> john douglas of birlstone manor <comma> then whose death
 have we been investigating for these two days <comma> and where in the world
 have you sprung from now <question> you seemed to me to come out of the floor
 like a jack-in-a-box <fullstop>
 ah <comma> mr <fullstop> mac <comma> said holmes <comma> shaking a reproving forefinger <comma> you
 would not read that excellent local compilation which described the
 concealment of king charles <fullstop> people did not hide in those days
 without excellent hiding places <comma> and the hiding place that has once
 been used may be again <fullstop> i had persuaded myself that we should find
 mr <fullstop> douglas under this roof <fullstop>
 and how long have you been playing this trick upon us <comma> mr <fullstop> holmes <question>
 said the inspector angrily <fullstop> how long have you allowed us to waste
 ourselves upon a search that you knew to be an absurd one <question>
 not one instant <comma> my dear mr <fullstop> mac <fullstop> only last night did i form my
 views of the case <fullstop> as they could not be put to the proof until this
 evening <comma> i invited you and your colleague to take a holiday for the
 day <fullstop> pray what more could i do <question> when i found the suit of clothes in
 the moat <comma> it at once became apparent to me that the body we had found
 could not have been the body of mr <fullstop> john douglas at all <comma> but must be
 that of the bicyclist from tunbridge wells <fullstop> no other conclusion was
 possible <fullstop> therefore i had to determine where mr <fullstop> john douglas himself
 could be <comma> and the balance of probability was that with the connivance
 of his wife and his friend he was concealed in a house which had such
 conveniences for a fugitive <comma> and awaiting quieter times when he could
 make his final escape <fullstop>
 well <comma> you figured it out about right <comma> said douglas approvingly <fullstop> i
 thought id dodge your british law for i was not sure how i stood
 under it <comma> and also i saw my chance to throw these hounds once for all
 off my track <fullstop> mind you <comma> from first to last i have done nothing to be
 ashamed of <comma> and nothing that i would not do again but youll judge
 that for yourselves when i tell you my story <fullstop> never mind warning me <comma>
 inspector im ready to stand pat upon the truth <fullstop>
 im not going to begin at the beginning <fullstop> thats all there <comma> he
 indicated my bundle of papers <comma> and a mighty queer yarn youll find
 it <fullstop> it all comes down to this that there are some men that have good
 cause to hate me and would give their last dollar to know that they
 had got me <fullstop> so long as i am alive and they are alive <comma> there is no
 safety in this world for me <fullstop> they hunted me from chicago to
 california <comma> then they chased me out of america but when i married
 and settled down in this quiet spot i thought my last years were
 going to be peaceable <fullstop>
 i never explained to my wife how things were <fullstop> why should i pull her
 into it <question> she would never have a quiet moment again but would always
 be imagining trouble <fullstop> i fancy she knew something <comma> for i may have
 dropped a word here or a word there but until yesterday <comma> after you
 gentlemen had seen her <comma> she never knew the rights of the matter <fullstop> she
 told you all she knew <comma> and so did barker here for on the night when
 this thing happened there was mighty little time for explanations <fullstop>
 she knows everything now <comma> and i would have been a wiser man if i had
 told her sooner <fullstop> but it was a hard question <comma> dear <comma> he took her hand
 for an instant in his own <comma> and i acted for the best <fullstop>
 well <comma> gentlemen <comma> the day before these happenings i was over in
 tunbridge wells <comma> and i got a glimpse of a man in the street <fullstop> it was
 only a glimpse but i have a quick eye for these things <comma> and i never
 doubted who it was <fullstop> it was the worst enemy i had among them all--one
 who has been after me like a hungry wolf after a caribou all these
 years <fullstop> i knew there was trouble coming <comma> and i came home and made
 ready for it <fullstop> i guessed id fight through it all right on my own <comma> my
 luck was a proverb in the states about 76 <fullstop> i never doubted that it
 would be with me still <fullstop>
 i was on my guard all that next day <comma> and never went out into the
 park <fullstop> its as well <comma> or hed have had the drop on me with that
 buckshot gun of his before ever i could draw on him <fullstop> after the bridge
 was up--my mind was always more restful when that bridge was up in
 the evenings--i put the thing clear out of my head <fullstop> i never dreamed
 of his getting into the house and waiting for me <fullstop> but when i made my
 round in my dressing gown <comma> as was my habit <comma> i had no sooner entered
 the study than i scented danger <fullstop> i guess when a man has had dangers
 in his life--and ive had more than most in my time--there is a kind
 of sixth sense that waves the red flag <fullstop> i saw the signal clear
 enough <comma> and yet i couldnt tell you why <fullstop> next instant i spotted a
 boot under the window curtain <comma> and then i saw why plain enough <fullstop>
 id just the one candle that was in my hand but there was a good
 light from the hall lamp through the open door <fullstop> i put down the candle
 and jumped for a hammer that id left on the mantel <fullstop> at the same
 moment he sprang at me <fullstop> i saw the glint of a knife <comma> and i lashed at
 him with the hammer <fullstop> i got him somewhere for the knife tinkled down
 on the floor <fullstop> he dodged round the table as quick as an eel <comma> and a
 moment later hed got his gun from under his coat <fullstop> i heard him cock
 it but i had got hold of it before he could fire <fullstop> i had it by the
 barrel <comma> and we wrestled for it all ends up for a minute or more <fullstop> it
 was death to the man that lost his grip <fullstop>
 he never lost his grip but he got it butt downward for a moment too
 long <fullstop> maybe it was i that pulled the trigger <fullstop> maybe we just jolted it
 off between us <fullstop> anyhow <comma> he got both barrels in the face <comma> and there i
 was <comma> staring down at all that was left of ted baldwin <fullstop> id recognized
 him in the township <comma> and again when he sprang for me but his own
 mother wouldnt recognize him as i saw him then <fullstop> im used to rough
 work but i fairly turned sick at the sight of him <fullstop>
 i was hanging on the side of the table when barker came hurrying
 down <fullstop> i heard my wife coming <comma> and i ran to the door and stopped her <fullstop>
 it was no sight for a woman <fullstop> i promised id come to her soon <fullstop> i said
 a word or two to barker--he took it all in at a glance--and we waited
 for the rest to come along <fullstop> but there was no sign of them <fullstop> then we
 understood that they could hear nothing <comma> and that all that had
 happened was known only to ourselves <fullstop>
 it was at that instant that the idea came to me <fullstop> i was fairly
 dazzled by the brilliance of it <fullstop> the mans sleeve had slipped up and
 there was the branded mark of the lodge upon his forearm <fullstop> see here
 the man whom we had known as douglas turned up his own coat and cuff
 to show a brown triangle within a circle exactly like that which we
 had seen upon the dead man <fullstop>
 it was the sight of that which started me on it <fullstop> i seemed to see it
 all clear at a glance <fullstop> there were his height and hair and figure <comma>
 about the same as my own <fullstop> no one could swear to his face <comma> poor devil
 i brought down this suit of clothes <comma> and in a quarter of an hour
 barker and i had put my dressing gown on him and he lay as you found
 him <fullstop> we tied all his things into a bundle <comma> and i weighted them with
 the only weight i could find and put them through the window <fullstop> the
 card he had meant to lay upon my body was lying beside his own <fullstop>
 my rings were put on his finger but when it came to the wedding
 ring <comma> he held out his muscular hand <comma> you can see for yourselves
 that i had struck the limit <fullstop> i have not moved it since the day i was
 married <comma> and it would have taken a file to get it off <fullstop> i dont know <comma>
 to i couldnt <fullstop> so we just had to leave that detail to take care of
 itself <fullstop> on the other hand <comma> i brought a bit of plaster down and put it
 where i am wearing one myself at this instant <fullstop> you slipped up there <comma>
 mr <fullstop> holmes <comma> clever as you are for if you had chanced to take off
 that plaster you would have found no cut underneath it <fullstop>
 well <comma> that was the situation <fullstop> if i could lie low for a while and
 then get away where i could be joined by my widow we should have a
 chance at last of living in peace for the rest of our lives <fullstop> these
 devils would give me no rest so long as i was above ground but if
 they saw in the papers that baldwin had got his man <comma> there would be
 an end of all my troubles <fullstop> i hadnt much time to make it all clear to
 barker and to my wife but they understood enough to be able to help
 me <fullstop> i knew all about this hiding place <comma> so did ames but it never
 entered his head to connect it with the matter <fullstop> i retired into it <comma>
 and it was up to barker to do the rest <fullstop>
 i guess you can fill in for yourselves what he did <fullstop> he opened the
 window and made the mark on the sill to give an idea of how the
 murderer escaped <fullstop> it was a tall order <comma> that but as the bridge was up
 there was no other way <fullstop> then <comma> when everything was fixed <comma> he rang the
 bell for all he was worth <fullstop> what happened afterward you know <fullstop> and so <comma>
 gentlemen <comma> you can do what you please but ive told you the truth
 and the whole truth <comma> so help me god what i ask you now is how do i
 stand by the english law <question>
 the english law is in the main a just law <fullstop> you will get no worse
 than your deserts from that <comma> mr <fullstop> douglas <fullstop> but i would ask you how did
 this man know that you lived here <comma> or how to get into your house <comma> or
 where to hide to get you <question>
 i know nothing of this <fullstop>
 holmess face was very white and grave <fullstop> the story is not over yet <comma> i
 fear <comma> said he <fullstop> you may find worse dangers than the english law <comma> or
 even than your enemies from america <fullstop> i see trouble before you <comma> mr <fullstop>
 douglas <fullstop> youll take my advice and still be on your guard <fullstop>
 and now <comma> my long-suffering readers <comma> i will ask you to come away with
 me for a time <comma> far from the sussex manor house of birlstone <comma> and far
 also from the year of grace in which we made our eventful journey
 which ended with the strange story of the man who had been known as
 john douglas <fullstop> i wish you to journey back some twenty years in time <comma>
 and westward some thousands of miles in space <comma> that i may lay before
 you a singular and terrible narrative--so singular and so terrible
 that you may find it hard to believe that even as i tell it <comma> even so
 did it occur <fullstop>
 do not think that i intrude one story before another is finished <fullstop> as
 you read on you will find that this is not so <fullstop> and when i have
 detailed those distant events and you have solved this mystery of the
 past <comma> we shall meet once more in those rooms on baker street <comma> where
 this <comma> like so many other wonderful happenings <comma> will find its end <fullstop>
 the scowrers
 the man
 it was the fourth of february in the year 1875 <fullstop> it had been a severe
 winter <comma> and the snow lay deep in the gorges of the gilmerton
 mountains <fullstop> the steam ploughs had <comma> however <comma> kept the railroad open <comma>
 and the evening train which connects the long line of coal-mining and
 iron-working settlements was slowly groaning its way up the steep
 gradients which lead from stagville on the plain to vermissa <comma> the
 central township which lies at the head of vermissa valley <fullstop> from this
 point the track sweeps downward to bartons crossing <comma> helmdale <comma> and
 the purely agricultural county of merton <fullstop> it was a single-track
 railroad but at every siding--and they were numerous--long lines of
 trucks piled with coal and iron ore told of the hidden wealth which
 had brought a rude population and a bustling life to this most
 desolate corner of the united states of america <fullstop>
 for desolate it was little could the first pioneer who had traversed
 it have ever imagined that the fairest prairies and the most lush
 water pastures were valueless compared to this gloomy land of black
 crag and tangled forest <fullstop> above the dark and often scarcely penetrable
 woods upon their flanks <comma> the high <comma> bare crowns of the mountains <comma>
 white snow <comma> and jagged rock towered upon each flank <comma> leaving a long <comma>
 winding <comma> tortuous valley in the centre <fullstop> up this the little train was
 slowly crawling <fullstop>
 the oil lamps had just been lit in the leading passenger car <comma> a long <comma>
 bare carriage in which some twenty or thirty people were seated <fullstop> the
 greater number of these were workmen returning from their days toil
 faces and the safety lanterns which they carried <comma> proclaimed
 themselves miners <fullstop> these sat smoking in a group and conversed in low
 voices <comma> glancing occasionally at two men on the opposite side of the
 car <comma> whose uniforms and badges showed them to be policemen <fullstop>
 several women of the labouring class and one or two travellers who
 might have been small local storekeepers made up the rest of the
 company <comma> with the exception of one young man in a corner by himself <fullstop>
 it is with this man that we are concerned <fullstop> take a good look at him <comma>
 for he is worth it <fullstop>
 he is a fresh-complexioned <comma> middle-sized young man <comma> not far <comma> one
 would guess <comma> from his thirtieth year <fullstop> he has large <comma> shrewd <comma> humorous
 gray eyes which twinkle inquiringly from time to time as he looks
 round through his spectacles at the people about him <fullstop> it is easy to
 see that he is of a sociable and possibly simple disposition <comma> anxious
 to be friendly to all men <fullstop> anyone could pick him at once as
 gregarious in his habits and communicative in his nature <comma> with a
 quick wit and a ready smile <fullstop> and yet the man who studied him more
 closely might discern a certain firmness of jaw and grim tightness
 about the lips which would warn him that there were depths beyond <comma>
 and that this pleasant <comma> brown-haired young irishman might conceivably
 leave his mark for good or evil upon any society to which he was
 introduced <fullstop>
 having made one or two tentative remarks to the nearest miner <comma> and
 receiving only short <comma> gruff replies <comma> the traveller resigned himself
 to uncongenial silence <comma> staring moodily out of the window at the
 fading landscape <fullstop>
 it was not a cheering prospect <fullstop> through the growing gloom there
 pulsed the red glow of the furnaces on the sides of the hills <fullstop> great
 heaps of slag and dumps of cinders loomed up on each side <comma> with the
 high shafts of the collieries towering above them <fullstop> huddled groups of
 mean <comma> wooden houses <comma> the windows of which were beginning to outline
 themselves in light <comma> were scattered here and there along the line <comma>
 and the frequent halting places were crowded with their swarthy
 inhabitants <fullstop>
 the iron and coal valleys of the vermissa district were no resorts
 for the leisured or the cultured <fullstop> everywhere there were stern signs
 of the crudest battle of life <comma> the rude work to be done <comma> and the
 rude <comma> strong workers who did it <fullstop>
 the young traveller gazed out into this dismal country with a face of
 mingled repulsion and interest <comma> which showed that the scene was new
 to him <fullstop> at intervals he drew from his pocket a bulky letter to which
 he referred <comma> and on the margins of which he scribbled some notes <fullstop>
 once from the back of his waist he produced something which one would
 hardly have expected to find in the possession of so mild-mannered a
 man <fullstop> it was a navy revolver of the largest size <fullstop> as he turned it
 slantwise to the light <comma> the glint upon the rims of the copper shells
 within the drum showed that it was fully loaded <fullstop> he quickly restored
 it to his secret pocket <comma> but not before it had been observed by a
 working man who had seated himself upon the adjoining bench <fullstop>
 hullo <comma> mate said he <fullstop> you seem heeled and ready <fullstop>
 the young man smiled with an air of embarrassment <fullstop>
 yes <comma> said he <comma> we need them sometimes in the place i come from <fullstop>
 and where may that be <question>
 im last from chicago <fullstop>
 yes <fullstop>
 you may find you need it here <comma> said the workman <fullstop>
 ah is that so <question> the young man seemed interested <fullstop>
 have you heard nothing of doings hereabouts <question>
 nothing out of the way <fullstop>
 why <comma> i thought the country was full of it <fullstop> youll hear quick enough <fullstop>
 what made you come here <question>
 i heard there was always work for a willing man <fullstop>
 are you a member of the union <question>
 sure <fullstop>
 then youll get your job <comma> i guess <fullstop> have you any friends <question>
 not yet but i have the means of making them <fullstop>
 hows that <comma> then <question>
 i am one of the eminent order of freemen <fullstop> theres no town without a
 lodge <comma> and where there is a lodge ill find my friends <fullstop>
 the remark had a singular effect upon his companion <fullstop> he glanced round
 suspiciously at the others in the car <fullstop> the miners were still
 whispering among themselves <fullstop> the two police officers were dozing <fullstop> he
 came across <comma> seated himself close to the young traveller <comma> and held
 out his hand <fullstop>
 put it there <comma> he said <fullstop>
 a hand-grip passed between the two <fullstop>
 i see you speak the truth <comma> said the workman <fullstop> but its well to make
 certain <fullstop> he raised his right hand to his right eyebrow <fullstop> the
 traveller at once raised his left hand to his left eyebrow <fullstop>
 dark nights are unpleasant <comma> said the workman <fullstop>
 yes <comma> for strangers to travel <comma> the other answered <fullstop>
 thats good enough <fullstop> im brother scanlan <comma> lodge 341 <comma> vermissa valley <fullstop>
 thank you <fullstop> im brother john mcmurdo <comma> lodge 29 <comma> chicago <fullstop> bodymaster
 j <fullstop> h <fullstop> scott <fullstop> but i am in luck to meet a brother so early <fullstop>
 well <comma> there are plenty of us about <fullstop> you wont find the order more
 flourishing anywhere in the states than right here in vermissa
 valley <fullstop> but we could do with some lads like you <fullstop> i cant understand a
 spry man of the union finding no work to do in chicago <fullstop>
 i found plenty of work to do <comma> said mcmurdo <fullstop>
 then why did you leave <question>
 mcmurdo nodded towards the policemen and smiled <fullstop> i guess those chaps
 would be glad to know <comma> he said <fullstop>
 scanlan groaned sympathetically <fullstop> in trouble <question> he asked in a whisper <fullstop>
 deep <fullstop>
 a penitentiary job <question>
 and the rest <fullstop>
 not a killing
 its early days to talk of such things <comma> said mcmurdo with the air
 of a man who had been surprised into saying more than he intended <fullstop>
 ive my own good reasons for leaving chicago <comma> and let that be enough
 for you <fullstop> who are you that you should take it on yourself to ask such
 things <question> his gray eyes gleamed with sudden and dangerous anger from
 behind his glasses <fullstop>
 all right <comma> mate <comma> no offense meant <fullstop> the boys will think none the
 worse of you <comma> whatever you may have done <fullstop> where are you bound for
 now <question>
 vermissa <fullstop>
 thats the third halt down the line <fullstop> where are you staying <question>
 mcmurdo took out an envelope and held it close to the murky oil lamp <fullstop>
 here is the address--jacob shafter <comma> sheridan street <fullstop> its a boarding
 house that was recommended by a man i knew in chicago <fullstop>
 well <comma> i dont know it but vermissa is out of my beat <fullstop> i live at
 hobsons patch <comma> and thats here where we are drawing up <fullstop> but <comma> say <comma>
 trouble in vermissa <comma> go straight to the union house and see boss
 mcginty <fullstop> he is the bodymaster of vermissa lodge <comma> and nothing can
 mate maybe well meet in lodge one of these evenings <fullstop> but mind my
 words if you are in trouble <comma> go to boss mcginty <fullstop>
 scanlan descended <comma> and mcmurdo was left once again to his thoughts <fullstop>
 night had now fallen <comma> and the flames of the frequent furnaces were
 roaring and leaping in the darkness <fullstop> against their lurid background
 dark figures were bending and straining <comma> twisting and turning <comma> with
 the motion of winch or of windlass <comma> to the rhythm of an eternal clank
 and roar <fullstop>
 i guess hell must look something like that <comma> said a voice <fullstop>
 mcmurdo turned and saw that one of the policemen had shifted in his
 seat and was staring out into the fiery waste <fullstop>
 for that matter <comma> said the other policeman <comma> i allow that hell must
 be something like that <fullstop> if there are worse devils down yonder than
 some we could name <comma> its more than id expect <fullstop> i guess you are new to
 well <comma> what if i am <question> mcmurdo answered in a surly voice <fullstop>
 just this <comma> mister <comma> that i should advise you to be careful in
 choosing your friends <fullstop> i dont think id begin with mike scanlan or
 his gang if i were you <fullstop>
 what the hell is it to you who are my friends <question> roared mcmurdo in a
 voice which brought every head in the carriage round to witness the
 altercation <fullstop> did i ask you for your advice <comma> or did you think me such
 a sucker that i couldnt move without it <question> you speak when you are
 spoken to <comma> and by the lord youd have to wait a long time if it was
 me he thrust out his face and grinned at the patrolmen like a
 snarling dog <fullstop>
 the two policemen <comma> heavy <comma> good-natured men <comma> were taken aback by the
 extraordinary vehemence with which their friendly advances had been
 rejected <fullstop>
 no offense <comma> stranger <comma> said one <fullstop> it was a warning for your own
 good <comma> seeing that you are <comma> by your own showing <comma> new to the place <fullstop>
 im new to the place but im not new to you and your kind cried
 mcmurdo in cold fury <fullstop> i guess youre the same in all places <comma> shoving
 your advice in when nobody asks for it <fullstop>
 maybe well see more of you before very long <comma> said one of the
 patrolmen with a grin <fullstop> youre a real hand-picked one <comma> if i am a
 judge <fullstop>
 i was thinking the same <comma> remarked the other <fullstop> i guess we may meet
 again <fullstop>
 im not afraid of you <comma> and dont you think it cried mcmurdo <fullstop> my
 names jack mcmurdo--see <question> if you want me <comma> youll find me at jacob
 shafters on sheridan street <comma> vermissa so im not hiding from you <comma>
 am i <question> day or night i dare to look the like of you in the face--dont
 make any mistake about that
 there was a murmur of sympathy and admiration from the miners at the
 dauntless demeanour of the newcomer <comma> while the two policemen shrugged
 their shoulders and renewed a conversation between themselves <fullstop>
 a few minutes later the train ran into the ill-lit station <comma> and there
 was a general clearing for vermissa was by far the largest town on
 the line <fullstop> mcmurdo picked up his leather gripsack and was about to
 start off into the darkness <comma> when one of the miners accosted him <fullstop>
 by gar <comma> mate you know how to speak to the cops <comma> he said in a voice
 of awe <fullstop> it was grand to hear you <fullstop> let me carry your grip and show
 you the road <fullstop> im passing shafters on the way to my own shack <fullstop>
 there was a chorus of friendly good-nights from the other miners as
 they passed from the platform <fullstop> before ever he had set foot in it <comma>
 mcmurdo the turbulent had become a character in vermissa <fullstop>
 the country had been a place of terror but the town was in its way
 even more depressing <fullstop> down that long valley there was at least a
 certain gloomy grandeur in the huge fires and the clouds of drifting
 smoke <comma> while the strength and industry of man found fitting monuments
 in the hills which he had spilled by the side of his monstrous
 excavations <fullstop> but the town showed a dead level of mean ugliness and
 squalor <fullstop> the broad street was churned up by the traffic into a
 horrible rutted paste of muddy snow <fullstop> the sidewalks were narrow and
 uneven <fullstop> the numerous gas-lamps served only to show more clearly a
 long line of wooden houses <comma> each with its veranda facing the street <comma>
 unkempt and dirty <fullstop>
 as they approached the centre of the town the scene was brightened by
 a row of well-lit stores <comma> and even more by a cluster of saloons and
 gaming houses <comma> in which the miners spent their hard-earned but
 generous wages <fullstop>
 thats the union house <comma> said the guide <comma> pointing to one saloon
 which rose almost to the dignity of being a hotel <fullstop> jack mcginty is
 the boss there <fullstop>
 what sort of a man is he <question> mcmurdo asked <fullstop>
 what have you never heard of the boss <question>
 how could i have heard of him when you know that i am a stranger in
 well <comma> i thought his name was known clear across the country <fullstop> its
 been in the papers often enough <fullstop>
 what for <question>
 well <comma> the miner lowered his voice--over the affairs <fullstop>
 what affairs <question>
 good lord <comma> mister you are queer <comma> if i must say it without offense <fullstop>
 and thats the affairs of the scowrers <fullstop>
 why <comma> i seem to have read of the scowrers in chicago <fullstop> a gang of
 murderers <comma> are they not <question>
 hush <comma> on your life cried the miner <comma> standing still in alarm <comma> and
 gazing in amazement at his companion <fullstop> man <comma> you wont live long in
 had the life beaten out of him for less <fullstop>
 well <comma> i know nothing about them <fullstop> its only what i have read <fullstop>
 and im not saying that you have not read the truth <fullstop> the man looked
 nervously round him as he spoke <comma> peering into the shadows as if he
 feared to see some lurking danger <fullstop> if killing is murder <comma> then god
 knows there is murder and to spare <fullstop> but dont you dare to breathe the
 name of jack mcginty in connection with it <comma> stranger for every
 whisper goes back to him <comma> and he is not one that is likely to let it
 pass <fullstop> now <comma> thats the house youre after <comma> that one standing back from
 the street <fullstop> youll find old jacob shafter that runs it as honest a
 man as lives in this township <fullstop>
 i thank you <comma> said mcmurdo <comma> and shaking hands with his new
 acquaintance he plodded <comma> gripsack in hand <comma> up the path which led to
 the dwelling house <comma> at the door of which he gave a resounding knock <fullstop>
 it was opened at once by someone very different from what he had
 expected <fullstop> it was a woman <comma> young and singularly beautiful <fullstop> she was of
 the german type <comma> blonde and fair-haired <comma> with the piquant contrast of
 a pair of beautiful dark eyes with which she surveyed the stranger
 with surprise and a pleasing embarrassment which brought a wave of
 colour over her pale face <fullstop> framed in the bright light of the open
 doorway <comma> it seemed to mcmurdo that he had never seen a more beautiful
 picture the more attractive for its contrast with the sordid and
 gloomy surroundings <fullstop> a lovely violet growing upon one of those black
 slag-heaps of the mines would not have seemed more surprising <fullstop> so
 entranced was he that he stood staring without a word <comma> and it was she
 who broke the silence <fullstop>
 i thought it was father <comma> said she with a pleasing little touch of a
 german accent <fullstop> did you come to see him <question> he is downtown <fullstop> i expect him
 back every minute <fullstop>
 mcmurdo continued to gaze at her in open admiration until her eyes
 dropped in confusion before this masterful visitor <fullstop>
 no <comma> miss <comma> he said at last <comma> im in no hurry to see him <fullstop> but your
 house was recommended to me for board <fullstop> i thought it might suit
 me--and now i know it will <fullstop>
 you are quick to make up your mind <comma> said she with a smile <fullstop>
 anyone but a blind man could do as much <comma> the other answered <fullstop>
 she laughed at the compliment <fullstop> come right in <comma> sir <comma> she said <fullstop> im
 miss ettie shafter <comma> mr <fullstop> shafters daughter <fullstop> my mothers dead <comma> and i
 run the house <fullstop> you can sit down by the stove in the front room until
 father comes along--ah <comma> here he is so you can fix things with him
 right away <fullstop>
 a heavy <comma> elderly man came plodding up the path <fullstop> in a few words
 mcmurdo explained his business <fullstop> a man of the name of murphy had given
 him the address in chicago <fullstop> he in turn had had it from someone else <fullstop>
 old shafter was quite ready <fullstop> the stranger made no bones about terms <comma>
 agreed at once to every condition <comma> and was apparently fairly flush of
 money <fullstop> for seven dollars a week paid in advance he was to have board
 and lodging <fullstop>
 so it was that mcmurdo <comma> the self-confessed fugitive from justice <comma>
 took up his abode under the roof of the shafters <comma> the first step
 which was to lead to so long and dark a train of events <comma> ending in a
 far distant land <fullstop>
 the bodymaster
 mcmurdo was a man who made his mark quickly <fullstop> wherever he was the folk
 around soon knew it <fullstop> within a week he had become infinitely the most
 important person at shafters <fullstop> there were ten or a dozen boarders
 there but they were honest foremen or commonplace clerks from the
 stores <comma> of a very different calibre from the young irishman <fullstop> of an
 evening when they gathered together his joke was always the readiest <comma>
 his conversation the brightest <comma> and his song the best <fullstop> he was a born
 boon companion <comma> with a magnetism which drew good humour from all
 around him <fullstop>
 and yet he showed again and again <comma> as he had shown in the railway
 carriage <comma> a capacity for sudden <comma> fierce anger <comma> which compelled the
 respect and even the fear of those who met him <fullstop> for the law <comma> too <comma> and
 all who were connected with it <comma> he exhibited a bitter contempt which
 delighted some and alarmed others of his fellow boarders <fullstop>
 from the first he made it evident <comma> by his open admiration <comma> that the
 daughter of the house had won his heart from the instant that he had
 set eyes upon her beauty and her grace <fullstop> he was no backward suitor <fullstop> on
 the second day he told her that he loved her <comma> and from then onward he
 repeated the same story with an absolute disregard of what she might
 say to discourage him <fullstop>
 someone else <question> he would cry <fullstop> well <comma> the worse luck for someone else
 let him look out for himself am i to lose my lifes chance and all
 my hearts desire for someone else <question> you can keep on saying no <comma> ettie
 the day will come when you will say yes <comma> and im young enough to
 wait <fullstop>
 he was a dangerous suitor <comma> with his glib irish tongue <comma> and his
 pretty <comma> coaxing ways <fullstop> there was about him also that glamour of
 experience and of mystery which attracts a womans interest <comma> and
 finally her love <fullstop> he could talk of the sweet valleys of county
 monaghan from which he came <comma> of the lovely <comma> distant island <comma> the low
 hills and green meadows of which seemed the more beautiful when
 imagination viewed them from this place of grime and snow <fullstop>
 then he was versed in the life of the cities of the north <comma> of
 detroit <comma> and the lumber camps of michigan <comma> and finally of chicago <comma>
 where he had worked in a planing mill <fullstop> and afterwards came the hint
 of romance <comma> the feeling that strange things had happened to him in
 that great city <comma> so strange and so intimate that they might not be
 spoken of <fullstop> he spoke wistfully of a sudden leaving <comma> a breaking of old
 ties <comma> a flight into a strange world <comma> ending in this dreary valley <comma>
 and ettie listened <comma> her dark eyes gleaming with pity and with
 sympathy--those two qualities which may turn so rapidly and so
 naturally to love <fullstop>
 mcmurdo had obtained a temporary job as bookkeeper for he was a
 well-educated man <fullstop> this kept him out most of the day <comma> and he had not
 found occasion yet to report himself to the head of the lodge of the
 eminent order of freemen <fullstop> he was reminded of his omission <comma> however <comma>
 by a visit one evening from mike scanlan <comma> the fellow member whom he
 had met in the train <fullstop> scanlan <comma> the small <comma> sharp-faced <comma> nervous <comma>
 black-eyed man <comma> seemed glad to see him once more <fullstop> after a glass or
 two of whisky he broached the object of his visit <fullstop>
 say <comma> mcmurdo <comma> said he <comma> i remembered your address <comma> so l made bold
 to call <fullstop> im surprised that youve not reported to the bodymaster <fullstop>
 why havent you seen boss mcginty yet <question>
 well <comma> i had to find a job <fullstop> i have been busy <fullstop>
 you must find time for him if you have none for anything else <fullstop> good
 lord <comma> man youre a fool not to have been down to the union house and
 registered your name the first morning after you came here if you
 run against him--well <comma> you mustnt <comma> thats all
 mcmurdo showed mild surprise <fullstop> ive been a member of the lodge for
 over two years <comma> scanlan <comma> but i never heard that duties were so
 pressing as all that <fullstop>
 maybe not in chicago <fullstop>
 well <comma> its the same society here <fullstop>
 is it <question>
 scanlan looked at him long and fixedly <fullstop> there was something sinister
 in his eyes <fullstop>
 isnt it <question>
 youll tell me that in a months time <fullstop> i hear you had a talk with
 the patrolmen after i left the train <fullstop>
 how did you know that <question>
 oh <comma> it got about--things do get about for good and for bad in this
 district <fullstop>
 well <comma> yes <fullstop> i told the hounds what i thought of them <fullstop>
 by the lord <comma> youll be a man after mcgintys heart
 what <comma> does he hate the police too <question>
 scanlan burst out laughing <fullstop> you go and see him <comma> my lad <comma> said he as
 he took his leave <fullstop> its not the police but you that hell hate if
 you dont now <comma> take a friends advice and go at once
 it chanced that on the same evening mcmurdo had another more pressing
 interview which urged him in the same direction <fullstop> it may have been
 that his attentions to ettie had been more evident than before <comma> or
 that they had gradually obtruded themselves into the slow mind of his
 good german host but <comma> whatever the cause <comma> the boarding-house keeper
 beckoned the young man into his private room and started on the
 subject without any circumlocution <fullstop>
 it seems to me <comma> mister <comma> said he <comma> that you are gettin set on my
 ettie <fullstop> aint that so <comma> or am i wrong <question>
 yes <comma> that is so <comma> the young man answered <fullstop>
 vell <comma> i vant to tell you right now that it aint no manner of use <fullstop>
 theres someone slipped in afore you <fullstop>
 she told me so <fullstop>
 vell <comma> you can lay that she told you truth <fullstop> but did she tell you who
 it vas <question>
 no <comma> i asked her but she wouldnt tell <fullstop>
 i dare say not <comma> the leetle baggage perhaps she did not vish to
 frighten you avay <fullstop>
 frighten mcmurdo was on fire in a moment <fullstop>
 ah <comma> yes <comma> my friend you need not be ashamed to be frightened of him <fullstop>
 it is teddy baldwin <fullstop>
 and who the devil is he <question>
 he is a boss of scowrers <fullstop>
 scowrers ive heard of them before <fullstop> its scowrers here and scowrers
 there <comma> and always in a whisper what are you all afraid of <question> who are
 the scowrers <question>
 the boarding-house keeper instinctively sank his voice <comma> as everyone
 did who talked about that terrible society <fullstop> the scowrers <comma> said he <comma>
 are the eminent order of freemen
 the young man stared <fullstop> why <comma> i am a member of that order myself <fullstop>
 you i vould never have had you in my house if i had known it--not
 if you vere to pay me a hundred dollar a week <fullstop>
 whats wrong with the order <question> its for charity and good fellowship <fullstop>
 the rules say so <fullstop>
 maybe in some places <fullstop> not here
 what is it here <question>
 its a murder society <comma> thats vat it is <fullstop>
 mcmurdo laughed incredulously <fullstop> how can you prove that <question> he asked <fullstop>
 prove it are there not fifty murders to prove it <question> vat about milman
 and van shorst <comma> and the nicholson family <comma> and old mr <fullstop> hyam <comma> and
 little billy james <comma> and the others <question> prove it is there a man or a
 voman in this valley vat does not know it <question>
 see here said mcmurdo earnestly <fullstop> i want you to take back what
 youve said <comma> or else make it good <fullstop> one or the other you must do
 before i quit this room <fullstop> put yourself in my place <fullstop> here am i <comma> a
 stranger in the town <fullstop> i belong to a society that i know only as an
 innocent one <fullstop> youll find it through the length and breadth of the
 states <comma> but always as an innocent one <fullstop> now <comma> when i am counting upon
 joining it here <comma> you tell me that it is the same as a murder society
 called the scowrers <fullstop> i guess you owe me either an apology or else an
 explanation <comma> mr <fullstop> shafter <fullstop>
 i can but tell you vat the whole vorld knows <comma> mister <fullstop> the bosses of
 the one are the bosses of the other <fullstop> if you offend the one <comma> it is the
 other vat vill strike you <fullstop> we have proved it too often <fullstop>
 thats just gossip--i want proof said mcmurdo <fullstop>
 if you live here long you vill get your proof <fullstop> but i forget that you
 are yourself one of them <fullstop> you vill soon be as bad as the rest <fullstop> but
 you vill find other lodgings <comma> mister <fullstop> i cannot have you here <fullstop> is it
 not bad enough that one of these people come courting my ettie <comma> and
 that i dare not turn him down <comma> but that i should have another for my
 boarder <question> yes <comma> indeed <comma> you shall not sleep here after to-night
 mcmurdo found himself under sentence of banishment both from his
 comfortable quarters and from the girl whom he loved <fullstop> he found her
 alone in the sitting-room that same evening <comma> and he poured his
 troubles into her ear <fullstop>
 sure <comma> your father is after giving me notice <comma> he said <fullstop> its little
 i would care if it was just my room <comma> but indeed <comma> ettie <comma> though its
 only a week that ive known you <comma> you are the very breath of life to
 me <comma> and i cant live without you
 oh <comma> hush <comma> mr <fullstop> mcmurdo <comma> dont speak so said the girl <fullstop> i have told
 you <comma> have i not <comma> that you are too late <question> there is another <comma> and if i
 have not promised to marry him at once <comma> at least i can promise no one
 else <fullstop>
 suppose i had been first <comma> ettie <comma> would i have had a chance <question>
 the girl sank her face into her hands <fullstop> i wish to heaven that you had
 been first she sobbed <fullstop>
 mcmurdo was down on his knees before her in an instant <fullstop> for gods
 sake <comma> ettie <comma> let it stand at that he cried <fullstop> will you ruin your
 life and my own for the sake of this promise <question> follow your heart <comma>
 acushla tis a safer guide than any promise before you knew what it
 was that you were saying <fullstop>
 he had seized etties white hand between his own strong brown ones <fullstop>
 say that you will be mine <comma> and we will face it out together
 not here <question>
 yes <comma> here <fullstop>
 no <comma> no <comma> jack his arms were round her now <fullstop> it could not be here <fullstop>
 could you take me away <question>
 a struggle passed for a moment over mcmurdos face but it ended by
 setting like granite <fullstop> no <comma> here <comma> he said <fullstop> ill hold you against the
 world <comma> ettie <comma> right here where we are
 why should we not leave together <question>
 no <comma> ettie <comma> i cant leave here <fullstop>
 but why <question>
 id never hold my head up again if i felt that i had been driven
 out <fullstop> besides <comma> what is there to be afraid of <question> are we not free folks in
 a free country <question> if you love me <comma> and i you <comma> who will dare to come
 between <question>
 you dont know <comma> jack <fullstop> youve been here too short a time <fullstop> you dont
 know this baldwin <fullstop> you dont know mcginty and his scowrers <fullstop>
 no <comma> i dont know them <comma> and i dont fear them <comma> and i dont believe in
 them said mcmurdo <fullstop> ive lived among rough men <comma> my darling <comma> and
 instead of fearing them it has always ended that they have feared
 me--always <comma> ettie <fullstop> its mad on the face of it if these men <comma> as your
 father says <comma> have done crime after crime in the valley <comma> and if
 everyone knows them by name <comma> how comes it that none are brought to
 justice <question> you answer me that <comma> ettie
 because no witness dares to appear against them <fullstop> he would not live a
 month if he did <fullstop> also because they have always their own men to swear
 that the accused one was far from the scene of the crime <fullstop> but surely <comma>
 jack <comma> you must have read all this <fullstop> i had understood that every paper
 in the united states was writing about it <fullstop>
 well <comma> i have read something <comma> it is true but i had thought it was a
 story <fullstop> maybe these men have some reason in what they do <fullstop> maybe they
 are wronged and have no other way to help themselves <fullstop>
 oh <comma> jack <comma> dont let me hear you speak so that is how he speaks--the
 other one
 baldwin--he speaks like that <comma> does he <question>
 and that is why i loathe him so <fullstop> oh <comma> jack <comma> now i can tell you the
 truth <fullstop> i loathe him with all my heart but i fear him also <fullstop> i fear
 him for myself but above all i fear him for father <fullstop> i know that some
 great sorrow would come upon us if i dared to say what i really felt <fullstop>
 that is why i have put him off with half-promises <fullstop> it was in real
 truth our only hope <fullstop> but if you would fly with me <comma> jack <comma> we could
 take father with us and live forever far from the power of these
 wicked men <fullstop>
 again there was the struggle upon mcmurdos face <comma> and again it set
 like granite <fullstop> no harm shall come to you <comma> ettie--nor to your father
 either <fullstop> as to wicked men <comma> i expect you may find that i am as bad as
 the worst of them before were through <fullstop>
 no <comma> no <comma> jack i would trust you anywhere <fullstop>
 mcmurdo laughed bitterly <fullstop> good lord how little you know of me your
 innocent soul <comma> my darling <comma> could not even guess what is passing in
 mine <fullstop> but <comma> hullo <comma> whos the visitor <question>
 the door had opened suddenly <comma> and a young fellow came swaggering in
 with the air of one who is the master <fullstop> he was a handsome <comma> dashing
 young man of about the same age and build as mcmurdo himself <fullstop> under
 his broad-brimmed black felt hat <comma> which he had not troubled to
 remove <comma> a handsome face with fierce <comma> domineering eyes and a curved
 hawk-bill of a nose looked savagely at the pair who sat by the stove <fullstop>
 ettie had jumped to her feet full of confusion and alarm <fullstop> im glad
 to see you <comma> mr <fullstop> baldwin <comma> said she <fullstop> youre earlier than i had
 thought <fullstop> come and sit down <fullstop>
 baldwin stood with his hands on his hips looking at mcmurdo <fullstop> who is
 this <question> he asked curtly <fullstop>
 its a friend of mine <comma> mr <fullstop> baldwin <comma> a new boarder here <fullstop> mr <fullstop> mcmurdo <comma>
 may i introduce you to mr <fullstop> baldwin <question>
 the young men nodded in surly fashion to each other <fullstop>
 maybe miss ettie has told you how it is with us <question> said baldwin <fullstop>
 i didnt understand that there was any relation between you <fullstop>
 didnt you <question> well <comma> you can understand it now <fullstop> you can take it from me
 that this young lady is mine <comma> and youll find it a very fine evening
 for a walk <fullstop>
 thank you <comma> i am in no humour for a walk <fullstop>
 arent you <question> the mans savage eyes were blazing with anger <fullstop> maybe
 you are in a humour for a fight <comma> mr <fullstop> boarder
 that i am cried mcmurdo <comma> springing to his feet <fullstop> you never said a
 more welcome word <fullstop>
 for gods sake <comma> jack oh <comma> for gods sake cried poor <comma> distracted
 ettie <fullstop> oh <comma> jack <comma> jack <comma> he will hurt you
 oh <comma> its jack <comma> is it <question> said baldwin with an oath <fullstop> youve come to
 that already <comma> have you <question>
 oh <comma> ted <comma> be reasonable--be kind for my sake <comma> ted <comma> if ever you loved
 me <comma> be big-hearted and forgiving
 i think <comma> ettie <comma> that if you were to leave us alone we could get this
 thing settled <comma> said mcmurdo quietly <fullstop> or maybe <comma> mr <fullstop> baldwin <comma> you
 will take a turn down the street with me <fullstop> its a fine evening <comma> and
 theres some open ground beyond the next block <fullstop>
 ill get even with you without needing to dirty my hands <comma> said his
 enemy <fullstop> youll wish you had never set foot in this house before i am
 through with you
 no time like the present <comma> cried mcmurdo <fullstop>
 ill choose my own time <comma> mister <fullstop> you can leave the time to me <fullstop> see
 here he suddenly rolled up his sleeve and showed upon his forearm a
 peculiar sign which appeared to have been branded there <fullstop> it was a
 circle with a triangle within it <fullstop> dyou know what that means <question>
 i neither know nor care
 well <comma> you will know <comma> ill promise you that <fullstop> you wont be much older <comma>
 either <fullstop> perhaps miss ettie can tell you something about it <fullstop> as to
 you <comma> ettie <comma> youll come back to me on your knees--dye hear <comma>
 girl <question>--on your knees--and then ill tell you what your punishment may
 be <fullstop> youve sowed--and by the lord <comma> ill see that you reap he
 glanced at them both in fury <fullstop> then he turned upon his heel <comma> and an
 instant later the outer door had banged behind him <fullstop>
 for a few moments mcmurdo and the girl stood in silence <fullstop> then she
 threw her arms around him <fullstop>
 oh <comma> jack <comma> how brave you were but it is no use <comma> you must fly
 to-night--jack--to-night its your only hope <fullstop> he will have your
 life <fullstop> i read it in his horrible eyes <fullstop> what chance have you against a
 dozen of them <comma> with boss mcginty and all the power of the lodge
 behind them <question>
 mcmurdo disengaged her hands <comma> kissed her <comma> and gently pushed her back
 into a chair <fullstop> there <comma> acushla <comma> there dont be disturbed or fear for
 me <fullstop> im a freeman myself <fullstop> im after telling your father about it <fullstop>
 maybe i am no better than the others so dont make a saint of me <fullstop>
 perhaps you hate me too <comma> now that ive told you as much <question>
 hate you <comma> jack <question> while life lasts i could never do that ive heard
 that there is no harm in being a freeman anywhere but here so why
 should i think the worse of you for that <question> but if you are a freeman <comma>
 jack <comma> why should you not go down and make a friend of boss mcginty <question>
 oh <comma> hurry <comma> jack <comma> hurry get your word in first <comma> or the hounds will be
 on your trail <fullstop>
 i was thinking the same thing <comma> said mcmurdo <fullstop> ill go right now and
 fix it <fullstop> you can tell your father that ill sleep here to-night and
 find some other quarters in the morning <fullstop>
 the bar of mcgintys saloon was crowded as usual <comma> for it was the
 favourite loafing place of all the rougher elements of the town <fullstop> the
 man was popular for he had a rough <comma> jovial disposition which formed
 this popularity <comma> the fear in which he was held throughout the
 township <comma> and indeed down the whole thirty miles of the valley and
 past the mountains on each side of it <comma> was enough in itself to fill
 his bar for none could afford to neglect his good will <fullstop>
 besides those secret powers which it was universally believed that he
 exercised in so pitiless a fashion <comma> he was a high public official <comma> a
 municipal councillor <comma> and a commissioner of roads <comma> elected to the
 office through the votes of the ruffians who in turn expected to
 receive favours at his hands <fullstop> assessments and taxes were enormous
 the public works were notoriously neglected <comma> the accounts were
 slurred over by bribed auditors <comma> and the decent citizen was
 terrorized into paying public blackmail <comma> and holding his tongue lest
 some worse thing befall him <fullstop>
 thus it was that <comma> year by year <comma> boss mcgintys diamond pins became
 more obtrusive <comma> his gold chains more weighty across a more gorgeous
 vest <comma> and his saloon stretched farther and farther <comma> until it
 threatened to absorb one whole side of the market square <fullstop>
 mcmurdo pushed open the swinging door of the saloon and made his way
 amid the crowd of men within <comma> through an atmosphere blurred with
 tobacco smoke and heavy with the smell of spirits <fullstop> the place was
 brilliantly lighted <comma> and the huge <comma> heavily gilt mirrors upon every
 wall reflected and multiplied the garish illumination <fullstop> there were
 several bartenders in their shirt sleeves <comma> hard at work mixing drinks
 for the loungers who fringed the broad <comma> brass-trimmed counter <fullstop>
 at the far end <comma> with his body resting upon the bar and a cigar stuck
 at an acute angle from the corner of his mouth <comma> stood a tall <comma> strong <comma>
 heavily built man who could be none other than the famous mcginty
 himself <fullstop> he was a black-maned giant <comma> bearded to the cheek-bones <comma> and
 with a shock of raven hair which fell to his collar <fullstop> his complexion
 was as swarthy as that of an italian <comma> and his eyes were of a strange
 dead black <comma> which <comma> combined with a slight squint <comma> gave them a
 all else in the man--his noble proportions <comma> his fine features <comma> and
 his frank bearing--fitted in with that jovial <comma> man-to-man manner
 which he affected <fullstop> here <comma> one would say <comma> is a bluff <comma> honest fellow <comma>
 whose heart would be sound however rude his outspoken words might
 seem <fullstop> it was only when those dead <comma> dark eyes <comma> deep and remorseless <comma>
 were turned upon a man that he shrank within himself <comma> feeling that he
 was face to face with an infinite possibility of latent evil <comma> with a
 strength and courage and cunning behind it which made it a thousand
 times more deadly <fullstop>
 having had a good look at his man <comma> mcmurdo elbowed his way forward
 with his usual careless audacity <comma> and pushed himself through the
 little group of courtiers who were fawning upon the powerful boss <comma>
 laughing uproariously at the smallest of his jokes <fullstop> the young
 strangers bold gray eyes looked back fearlessly through their
 glasses at the deadly black ones which turned sharply upon him <fullstop>
 well <comma> young man <comma> i cant call your face to mind <fullstop>
 im new here <comma> mr <fullstop> mcginty <fullstop>
 you are not so new that you cant give a gentleman his proper
 title <fullstop>
 hes councillor mcginty <comma> young man <comma> said a voice from the group <fullstop>
 im sorry <comma> councillor <fullstop> im strange to the ways of the place <fullstop> but i
 was advised to see you <fullstop>
 well <comma> you see me <fullstop> this is all there is <fullstop> what dyou think of me <question>
 well <comma> its early days <fullstop> if your heart is as big as your body <comma> and
 your soul as fine as your face <comma> then id ask for nothing better <comma>
 said mcmurdo <fullstop>
 by gar youve got an irish tongue in your head anyhow <comma> cried the
 saloon-keeper <comma> not quite certain whether to humour this audacious
 visitor or to stand upon his dignity <fullstop>
 so you are good enough to pass my appearance <question>
 sure <comma> said mcmurdo <fullstop>
 and you were told to see me <question>
 i was <fullstop>
 and who told you <question>
 brother scanlan of lodge 341 <comma> vermissa <fullstop> i drink your health
 councillor <comma> and to our better acquaintance <fullstop> he raised a glass with
 which he had been served to his lips and elevated his little finger
 as he drank it <fullstop>
 mcginty <comma> who had been watching him narrowly <comma> raised his thick black
 eyebrows <fullstop> oh <comma> its like that <comma> is it <question> said he <fullstop> ill have to look a
 bit closer into this <comma> mister--
 mcmurdo <fullstop>
 a bit closer <comma> mr <fullstop> mcmurdo for we dont take folk on trust in these
 behind the bar <fullstop>
 there was a small room there <comma> lined with barrels <fullstop> mcginty carefully
 closed the door <comma> and then seated himself on one of them <comma> biting
 thoughtfully on his cigar and surveying his companion with those
 disquieting eyes <fullstop> for a couple of minutes he sat in complete silence <fullstop>
 mcmurdo bore the inspection cheerfully <comma> one hand in his coat pocket <comma>
 the other twisting his brown moustache <fullstop> suddenly mcginty stooped and
 produced a wicked-looking revolver <fullstop>
 see here <comma> my joker <comma> said he <comma> if i thought you were playing any
 game on us <comma> it would be short work for you <fullstop>
 this is a strange welcome <comma> mcmurdo answered with some dignity <comma> for
 the bodymaster of a lodge of freemen to give to a stranger brother <fullstop>
 ay <comma> but its just that same that you have to prove <comma> said mcginty <comma>
 and god help you if you fail where were you made <question>
 lodge 29 <comma> chicago <fullstop>
 when <question>
 june 24 <comma> 1872 <fullstop>
 what bodymaster <question>
 james h <fullstop> scott <fullstop>
 who is your district ruler <question>
 bartholomew wilson <fullstop>
 hum you seem glib enough in your tests <fullstop> what are you doing here <question>
 working <comma> the same as you--but a poorer job <fullstop>
 you have your back answer quick enough <fullstop>
 yes <comma> i was always quick of speech <fullstop>
 are you quick of action <question>
 i have had that name among those that knew me best <fullstop>
 well <comma> we may try you sooner than you think <fullstop> have you heard anything
 ive heard that it takes a man to be a brother <fullstop>
 true for you <comma> mr <fullstop> mcmurdo <fullstop> why did you leave chicago <question>
 im damned if i tell you that
 mcginty opened his eyes <fullstop> he was not used to being answered in such
 fashion <comma> and it amused him <fullstop> why wont you tell me <question>
 because no brother may tell another a lie <fullstop>
 then the truth is too bad to tell <question>
 you can put it that way if you like <fullstop>
 see here <comma> mister <comma> you cant expect me <comma> as bodymaster <comma> to pass into
 the lodge a man for whose past he cant answer <fullstop>
 mcmurdo looked puzzled <fullstop> then he took a worn newspaper cutting from an
 inner pocket <fullstop>
 you wouldnt squeal on a fellow <question> said he <fullstop>
 ill wipe my hand across your face if you say such words to me
 cried mcginty hotly <fullstop>
 you are right <comma> councillor <comma> said mcmurdo meekly <fullstop> i should
 apologize <fullstop> i spoke without thought <fullstop> well <comma> i know that i am safe in
 your hands <fullstop> look at that clipping <fullstop>
 mcginty glanced his eyes over the account of the shooting of one
 jonas pinto <comma> in the lake saloon <comma> market street <comma> chicago <comma> in the new
 year week of 1874 <fullstop>
 your work <question> he asked <comma> as he handed back the paper <fullstop>
 mcmurdo nodded <fullstop>
 why did you shoot him <question>
 i was helping uncle sam to make dollars <fullstop> maybe mine were not as good
 gold as his <comma> but they looked as well and were cheaper to make <fullstop> this
 man pinto helped me to shove the queer--
 to do what <question>
 well <comma> it means to pass the dollars out into circulation <fullstop> then he
 said he would split <fullstop> maybe he did split <fullstop> i didnt wait to see <fullstop> i just
 killed him and lighted out for the coal country <fullstop>
 why the coal country <question>
 mcginty laughed <fullstop> you were first a coiner and then a murderer <comma> and
 thats about the size of it <comma> mcmurdo answered <fullstop>
 well <comma> i guess youll go far <fullstop> say <comma> can you make those dollars yet <question>
 mcmurdo took half a dozen from his pocket <fullstop> those never passed the
 philadelphia mint <comma> said he <fullstop>
 you dont say mcginty held them to the light in his enormous hand <comma>
 which was hairy as a gorillas <fullstop> i can see no difference <fullstop> gar youll
 be a mighty useful brother <comma> im thinking we can do with a bad man or
 two among us <comma> friend mcmurdo for there are times when we have to
 back at those that were pushing us <fullstop>
 well <comma> i guess ill do my share of shoving with the rest of the
 boys <fullstop>
 you seem to have a good nerve <fullstop> you didnt squirm when i shoved this
 gun at you <fullstop>
 it was not me that was in danger <fullstop>
 who then <question>
 it was you <comma> councillor <fullstop> mcmurdo drew a cocked pistol from the side
 pocket of his peajacket <fullstop> i was covering you all the time <fullstop> i guess my
 shot would have been as quick as yours <fullstop>
 by gar mcginty flushed an angry red and then burst into a roar of
 laughter <fullstop> say <comma> weve had no such holy terror come to hand this many
 a year <fullstop> i reckon the lodge will learn to be proud of you  <fullstop> <fullstop> <fullstop> well <comma>
 what the hell do you want <question> and cant i speak alone with a gentleman
 for five minutes but you must butt in on us <question>
 the bartender stood abashed <fullstop> im sorry <comma> councillor <comma> but its ted
 baldwin <fullstop> he says he must see you this very minute <fullstop>
 the message was unnecessary for the set <comma> cruel face of the man
 himself was looking over the servants shoulder <fullstop> he pushed the
 bartender out and closed the door on him <fullstop>
 so <comma> said he with a furious glance at mcmurdo <comma> you got here first <comma>
 did you <question> ive a word to say to you <comma> councillor <comma> about this man <fullstop>
 then say it here and now before my face <comma> cried mcmurdo <fullstop>
 ill say it at my own time <comma> in my own way <fullstop>
 tut tut said mcginty <comma> getting off his barrel <fullstop> this will never
 do <fullstop> we have a new brother here <comma> baldwin <comma> and its not for us to greet
 him in such fashion <fullstop> hold out your hand <comma> man <comma> and make it up
 never cried baldwin in a fury <fullstop>
 ive offered to fight him if he thinks i have wronged him <comma> said
 mcmurdo <fullstop> ill fight him with fists <comma> or <comma> if that wont satisfy him <comma>
 ill fight him any other way he chooses <fullstop> now <comma> ill leave it to you <comma>
 councillor <comma> to judge between us as a bodymaster should <fullstop>
 what is it <comma> then <question>
 a young lady <fullstop> shes free to choose for herself <fullstop>
 is she <question> cried baldwin <fullstop>
 as between two brothers of the lodge i should say that she was <comma>
 said the boss <fullstop>
 oh <comma> thats your ruling <comma> is it <question>
 yes <comma> it is <comma> ted baldwin <comma> said mcginty <comma> with a wicked stare <fullstop> is it
 you that would dispute it <question>
 you would throw over one that has stood by you this five years in
 favour of a man that you never saw before in your life <question> youre not
 bodymaster for life <comma> jack mcginty <comma> and by god when next it comes to
 a vote--
 the councillor sprang at him like a tiger <fullstop> his hand closed round the
 others neck <comma> and he hurled him back across one of the barrels <fullstop> in
 his mad fury he would have squeezed the life out of him if mcmurdo
 had not interfered <fullstop>
 easy <comma> councillor for heavens sake <comma> go easy he cried <comma> as he
 dragged him back <fullstop>
 mcginty released his hold <comma> and baldwin <comma> cowed and shaken gasping for
 breath <comma> and shivering in every limb <comma> as one who has looked over the
 very edge of death <comma> sat up on the barrel over which he had been
 hurled <fullstop>
 youve been asking for it this many a day <comma> ted baldwin--now youve
 got it cried mcginty <comma> his huge chest rising and falling <fullstop> maybe you
 think if i was voted down from bodymaster you would find yourself in
 my shoes <fullstop> its for the lodge to say that <fullstop> but so long as i am the
 chief ill have no man lift his voice against me or my rulings <fullstop>
 i have nothing against you <comma> mumbled baldwin <comma> feeling his throat <fullstop>
 well <comma> then <comma> cried the other <comma> relapsing in a moment into a bluff
 joviality <comma> we are all good friends again and theres an end of the
 matter <fullstop>
 he took a bottle of champagne down from the shelf and twisted out the
 cork <fullstop>
 see now <comma> he continued <comma> as he filled three high glasses <fullstop> let us
 drink the quarrelling toast of the lodge <fullstop> after that <comma> as you know <comma>
 there can be no bad blood between us <fullstop> now <comma> then the left hand on the
 apple of my throat <fullstop> i say to you <comma> ted baldwin <comma> what is the offense <comma>
 sir <question>
 the clouds are heavy <comma> answered baldwin <fullstop>
 but they will forever brighten <fullstop>
 and this i swear
 the men drank their glasses <comma> and the same ceremony was performed
 between baldwin and mcmurdo
 there cried mcginty <comma> rubbing his hands <fullstop> thats the end of the
 black blood <fullstop> you come under lodge discipline if it goes further <comma> and
 you will damn soon find out <comma> brother mcmurdo <comma> if you ask for
 trouble
 faith <comma> id be slow to do that <comma> said mcmurdo <fullstop> he held out his hand
 to baldwin <fullstop> im quick to quarrel and quick to forgive <fullstop> its my hot
 irish blood <comma> they tell me <fullstop> but its over for me <comma> and i bear no
 grudge <fullstop>
 baldwin had to take the proffered hand <comma> for the baleful eye of the
 terrible boss was upon him <fullstop> but his sullen face showed how little the
 words of the other had moved him <fullstop>
 mcginty clapped them both on the shoulders <fullstop> tut these girls these
 girls he cried <fullstop> to think that the same petticoats should come
 between two of my boys its the devils own luck well <comma> its the
 colleen inside of them that must settle the question for its outside
 the jurisdiction of a bodymaster--and the lord be praised for that
 we have enough on us <comma> without the women as well <fullstop> youll have to be
 affiliated to lodge 341 <comma> brother mcmurdo <fullstop> we have our own ways and
 methods <comma> different from chicago <fullstop> saturday night is our meeting <comma> and
 if you come then <comma> well make you free forever of the vermissa
 valley <fullstop>
 lodge 341 <comma> vermissa
 on the day following the evening which had contained so many exciting
 events <comma> mcmurdo moved his lodgings from old jacob shafters and took
 up his quarters at the widow macnamaras on the extreme outskirts of
 the town <fullstop> scanlan <comma> his original acquaintance aboard the train <comma> had
 occasion shortly afterwards to move into vermissa <comma> and the two lodged
 together <fullstop> there was no other boarder <comma> and the hostess was an
 easy-going old irishwoman who left them to themselves so that they
 had a freedom for speech and action welcome to men who had secrets in
 common <fullstop>
 shafter had relented to the extent of letting mcmurdo come to his
 meals there when he liked so that his intercourse with ettie was by
 no means broken <fullstop> on the contrary <comma> it drew closer and more intimate as
 the weeks went by <fullstop>
 in his bedroom at his new abode mcmurdo felt it safe to take out the
 coining moulds <comma> and under many a pledge of secrecy a number of
 brothers from the lodge were allowed to come in and see them <comma> each
 carrying away in his pocket some examples of the false money <comma> so
 cunningly struck that there was never the slightest difficulty or
 danger in passing it <fullstop> why <comma> with such a wonderful art at his command <comma>
 mcmurdo should condescend to work at all was a perpetual mystery to
 his companions though he made it clear to anyone who asked him that
 if he lived without any visible means it would very quickly bring the
 police upon his track <fullstop>
 one policeman was indeed after him already but the incident <comma> as luck
 would have it <comma> did the adventurer a great deal more good than harm <fullstop>
 after the first introduction there were few evenings when he did not
 find his way to mcgintys saloon <comma> there to make closer acquaintance
 with the boys <comma> which was the jovial title by which the dangerous
 gang who infested the place were known to one another <fullstop> his dashing
 manner and fearlessness of speech made him a favourite with them all
 while the rapid and scientific way in which he polished off his
 antagonist in an all in bar-room scrap earned the respect of that
 rough community <fullstop> another incident <comma> however <comma> raised him even higher in
 their estimation <fullstop>
 just at the crowded hour one night <comma> the door opened and a man entered
 with the quiet blue uniform and peaked cap of the mine police <fullstop> this
 was a special body raised by the railways and colliery owners to
 supplement the efforts of the ordinary civil police <comma> who were
 perfectly helpless in the face of the organized ruffianism which
 terrorized the district <fullstop> there was a hush as he entered <comma> and many a
 curious glance was cast at him but the relations between policemen
 himself standing behind his counter <comma> showed no surprise when the
 policeman enrolled himself among his customers <fullstop>
 a straight whisky <comma> for the night is bitter <comma> said the police
 officer <fullstop> i dont think we have met before <comma> councillor <question>
 youll be the new captain <question> said mcginty <fullstop>
 thats so <fullstop> were looking to you <comma> councillor <comma> and to the other
 leading citizens <comma> to help us in upholding law and order in this
 township <fullstop> captain marvin is my name <fullstop>
 wed do better without you <comma> captain marvin <comma> said mcginty coldly
 for we have our own police of the township <comma> and no need for any
 imported goods <fullstop> what are you but the paid tool of the capitalists <comma>
 hired by them to club or shoot your poorer fellow citizen <question>
 well <comma> well <comma> we wont argue about that <comma> said the police officer
 good-humouredly <fullstop> i expect we all do our duty same as we see it but
 we cant all see it the same <fullstop> he had drunk off his glass and had
 turned to go <comma> when his eyes fell upon the face of jack mcmurdo <comma> who
 was scowling at his elbow <fullstop> hullo hullo he cried <comma> looking him up
 and down <fullstop> heres an old acquaintance
 mcmurdo shrank away from him <fullstop> i was never a friend to you nor any
 other cursed copper in my life <comma> said he <fullstop>
 an acquaintance isnt always a friend <comma> said the police captain <comma>
 grinning <fullstop> youre jack mcmurdo of chicago <comma> right enough <comma> and dont
 you deny it
 mcmurdo shrugged his shoulders <fullstop> im not denying it <comma> said he <fullstop> dye
 think im ashamed of my own name <question>
 youve got good cause to be <comma> anyhow <fullstop>
 what the devil dyou mean by that <question> he roared with his fists
 clenched <fullstop>
 no <comma> no <comma> jack <comma> bluster wont do with me <fullstop> i was an officer in chicago
 before ever i came to this darned coal bunker <comma> and i know a chicago
 crook when i see one <fullstop>
 mcmurdos face fell <fullstop> dont tell me that youre marvin of the chicago
 central he cried <fullstop>
 just the same old teddy marvin <comma> at your service <fullstop> we havent
 forgotten the shooting of jonas pinto up there <fullstop>
 i never shot him <fullstop>
 death came in uncommon handy for you <comma> or they would have had you for
 shoving the queer <fullstop> well <comma> we can let that be bygones for <comma> between you
 and me--and perhaps im going further than my duty in saying it--they
 could get no clear case against you <comma> and chicagos open to you
 to-morrow <fullstop>
 im very well where i am <fullstop>
 well <comma> ive given you the pointer <comma> and youre a sulky dog not to
 thank me for it <fullstop>
 well <comma> i suppose you mean well <comma> and i do thank you <comma> said mcmurdo in
 no very gracious manner <fullstop>
 its mum with me so long as i see you living on the straight <comma> said
 the captain <fullstop> but <comma> by the lord if you get off after this <comma> its
 another story so good-night to you--and goodnight <comma> councillor <fullstop>
 he left the bar-room but not before he had created a local hero <fullstop>
 mcmurdos deeds in far chicago had been whispered before <fullstop> he had put
 off all questions with a smile <comma> as one who did not wish to have
 greatness thrust upon him <fullstop> but now the thing was officially
 confirmed <fullstop> the bar loafers crowded round him and shook him heartily
 by the hand <fullstop> he was free of the community from that time on <fullstop> he could
 drink hard and show little trace of it but that evening <comma> had his
 mate scanlan not been at hand to lead him home <comma> the feted hero would
 surely have spent his night under the bar <fullstop>
 on a saturday night mcmurdo was introduced to the lodge <fullstop> he had
 thought to pass in without ceremony as being an initiate of chicago
 and these had to be undergone by every postulant <fullstop> the assembly met in
 a large room reserved for such purposes at the union house <fullstop> some
 sixty members assembled at vermissa but that by no means represented
 the full strength of the organization <comma> for there were several other
 lodges in the valley <comma> and others across the mountains on each side <comma>
 who exchanged members when any serious business was afoot <comma> so that a
 crime might be done by men who were strangers to the locality <fullstop>
 altogether there were not less than five hundred scattered over the
 coal district <fullstop>
 in the bare assembly room the men were gathered round a long table <fullstop>
 at the side was a second one laden with bottles and glasses <comma> on which
 some members of the company were already turning their eyes <fullstop> mcginty
 sat at the head with a flat black velvet cap upon his shock of
 tangled black hair <comma> and a coloured purple stole round his neck <comma> so
 that he seemed to be a priest presiding over some diabolical ritual <fullstop>
 to right and left of him were the higher lodge officials <comma> the cruel <comma>
 handsome face of ted baldwin among them <fullstop> each of these wore some
 scarf or medallion as emblem of his office <fullstop>
 company consisted of young fellows from eighteen to twenty-five <comma> the
 ready and capable agents who carried out the commands of their
 seniors <fullstop> among the older men were many whose features showed the
 tigerish <comma> lawless souls within but looking at the rank and file it
 was difficult to believe that these eager and open-faced young
 fellows were in very truth a dangerous gang of murderers <comma> whose minds
 had suffered such complete moral perversion that they took a horrible
 pride in their proficiency at the business <comma> and looked with deepest
 respect at the man who had the reputation of making what they called
 a clean job <fullstop>
 to their contorted natures it had become a spirited and chivalrous
 thing to volunteer for service against some man who had never injured
 them <comma> and whom in many cases they had never seen in their lives <fullstop> the
 crime committed <comma> they quarrelled as to who had actually struck the
 fatal blow <comma> and amused one another and the company by describing the
 cries and contortions of the murdered man <fullstop>
 at first they had shown some secrecy in their arrangements but at
 the time which this narrative describes their proceedings were
 extraordinarily open <comma> for the repeated failures of the law had proved
 to them that <comma> on the one hand <comma> no one would dare to witness against
 them <comma> and on the other they had an unlimited number of stanch
 witnesses upon whom they could call <comma> and a well-filled treasure chest
 from which they could draw the funds to engage the best legal talent
 in the state <fullstop> in ten long years of outrage there had been no single
 conviction <comma> and the only danger that ever threatened the scowrers lay
 in the victim himself--who <comma> however outnumbered and taken by
 surprise <comma> might and occasionally did leave his mark upon his
 assailants <fullstop>
 mcmurdo had been warned that some ordeal lay before him but no one
 would tell him in what it consisted <fullstop> he was led now into an outer
 hear the murmur of many voices from the assembly within <fullstop> once or
 twice he caught the sound of his own name <comma> and he knew that they were
 discussing his candidacy <fullstop> then there entered an inner guard with a
 green and gold sash across his chest <fullstop>
 the bodymaster orders that he shall be trussed <comma> blinded <comma> and
 entered <comma> said he <fullstop>
 the three of them removed his coat <comma> turned up the sleeve of his right
 arm <comma> and finally passed a rope round above the elbows and made it
 fast <fullstop> they next placed a thick black cap right over his head and the
 into the assembly hall <fullstop>
 it was pitch dark and very oppressive under his hood <fullstop> he heard the
 rustle and murmur of the people round him <comma> and then the voice of
 mcginty sounded dull and distant through the covering of his ears <fullstop>
 john mcmurdo <comma> said the voice <comma> are you already a member of the
 ancient order of freemen <question>
 he bowed in assent <fullstop>
 is your lodge no <fullstop> 29 <comma> chicago <question>
 he bowed again <fullstop>
 dark nights are unpleasant <comma> said the voice <fullstop>
 yes <comma> for strangers to travel <comma> he answered <fullstop>
 the clouds are heavy <fullstop>
 yes <comma> a storm is approaching <fullstop>
 are the brethren satisfied <question> asked the bodymaster <fullstop>
 there was a general murmur of assent <fullstop>
 we know <comma> brother <comma> by your sign and by your countersign that you are
 indeed one of us <comma> said mcginty <fullstop> we would have you know <comma> however <comma>
 certain rites <comma> and also certain duties of our own which call for good
 men <fullstop> are you ready to be tested <question>
 i am <fullstop>
 are you of stout heart <question>
 i am <fullstop>
 take a stride forward to prove it <fullstop>
 as the words were said he felt two hard points in front of his eyes <comma>
 pressing upon them so that it appeared as if he could not move
 forward without a danger of losing them <fullstop> none the less <comma> he nerved
 himself to step resolutely out <comma> and as he did so the pressure melted
 away <fullstop> there was a low murmur of applause <fullstop>
 he is of stout heart <comma> said the voice <fullstop> can you bear pain <question>
 as well as another <comma> he answered <fullstop>
 test him
 it was all he could do to keep himself from screaming out <comma> for an
 agonizing pain shot through his forearm <fullstop> he nearly fainted at the
 sudden shock of it but he bit his lip and clenched his hands to hide
 his agony <fullstop>
 i can take more than that <comma> said he <fullstop>
 this time there was loud applause <fullstop> a finer first appearance had never
 been made in the lodge <fullstop> hands clapped him on the back <comma> and the hood
 was plucked from his head <fullstop> he stood blinking and smiling amid the
 congratulations of the brothers <fullstop>
 one last word <comma> brother mcmurdo <comma> said mcginty <fullstop> you have already
 sworn the oath of secrecy and fidelity <comma> and you are aware that the
 punishment for any breach of it is instant and inevitable death <question>
 i am <comma> said mcmurdo <fullstop>
 and you accept the rule of the bodymaster for the time being under
 all circumstances <question>
 i do <fullstop>
 then in the name of lodge 341 <comma> vermissa <comma> i welcome you to its
 privileges and debates <fullstop> you will put the liquor on the table <comma> brother
 scanlan <comma> and we will drink to our worthy brother <fullstop>
 mcmurdos coat had been brought to him but before putting it on he
 examined his right arm <comma> which still smarted heavily <fullstop> there on the
 flesh of the forearm was a circle with a triangle within it <comma> deep and
 red <comma> as the branding iron had left it <fullstop> one or two of his neighbours
 pulled up their sleeves and showed their own lodge marks <fullstop>
 weve all had it <comma> said one but not all as brave as you over it <fullstop>
 tut it was nothing <comma> said he but it burned and ached all the same <fullstop>
 when the drinks which followed the ceremony of initiation had all
 been disposed of <comma> the business of the lodge proceeded <fullstop> mcmurdo <comma>
 accustomed only to the prosaic performances of chicago <comma> listened with
 open ears and more surprise than he ventured to show to what
 followed <fullstop>
 the first business on the agenda paper <comma> said mcginty <comma> is to read
 the following letter from division master windle of merton county
 lodge 249 <fullstop> he says
 dear sir
 there is a job to be done on andrew rae of rae sturmash <comma> coal
 owners near this place <fullstop> you will remember that your lodge owes us a
 return <comma> having had the service of two brethren in the matter of the
 patrolman last fall <fullstop> you will send two good men <comma> they will be taken
 charge of by treasurer higgins of this lodge <comma> whose address you know <fullstop>
 he will show them when to act and where <fullstop> yours in freedom <comma>
 j <fullstop> w <fullstop> windle d <fullstop> m <fullstop> a <fullstop> o <fullstop> f <fullstop>
 windle has never refused us when we have had occasion to ask for the
 loan of a man or two <comma> and it is not for us to refuse him <fullstop> mcginty
 paused and looked round the room with his dull <comma> malevolent eyes <fullstop> who
 will volunteer for the job <question>
 several young fellows held up their hands <fullstop> the bodymaster looked at
 them with an approving smile <fullstop>
 youll do <comma> tiger cormac <fullstop> if you handle it as well as you did the
 last <comma> you wont be wrong <fullstop> and you <comma> wilson <fullstop>
 ive no pistol <comma> said the volunteer <comma> a mere boy in his teens <fullstop>
 its your first <comma> is it not <question> well <comma> you have to be blooded some time <fullstop>
 it will be a great start for you <fullstop> as to the pistol <comma> youll find it
 waiting for you <comma> or im mistaken <fullstop> if you report yourselves on monday <comma>
 it will be time enough <fullstop> youll get a great welcome when you return <fullstop>
 any reward this time <question> asked cormac <comma> a thick-set <comma> dark-faced <comma>
 brutal-looking young man <comma> whose ferocity had earned him the nickname
 of tiger <fullstop>
 never mind the reward <fullstop> you just do it for the honour of the thing <fullstop>
 maybe when it is done there will be a few odd dollars at the bottom
 of the box <fullstop>
 what has the man done <question> asked young wilson <fullstop>
 sure <comma> its not for the likes of you to ask what the man has done <fullstop> he
 has been judged over there <fullstop> thats no business of ours <fullstop> all we have
 to do is to carry it out for them <comma> same as they would for us <fullstop>
 speaking of that <comma> two brothers from the merton lodge are coming over
 to us next week to do some business in this quarter <fullstop>
 who are they <question> asked someone <fullstop>
 faith <comma> it is wiser not to ask <fullstop> if you know nothing <comma> you can testify
 nothing <comma> and no trouble can come of it <fullstop> but they are men who will
 make a clean job when they are about it <fullstop>
 and time <comma> too cried ted baldwin <fullstop> folk are gettin out of hand in
 off by foreman blaker <fullstop> its been owing him a long time <comma> and hell get
 it full and proper <fullstop>
 get what <question> mcmurdo whispered to his neighbour <fullstop>
 the business end of a buckshot cartridge cried the man with a loud
 laugh <fullstop> what think you of our ways <comma> brother <question>
 mcmurdos criminal soul seemed to have already absorbed the spirit of
 the vile association of which he was now a member <fullstop> i like it well <comma>
 said he <fullstop> tis a proper place for a lad of mettle <fullstop>
 several of those who sat around heard his words and applauded them <fullstop>
 whats that <question> cried the black-maned bodymaster from the end of the
 table <fullstop>
 tis our new brother <comma> sir <comma> who finds our ways to his taste <fullstop>
 mcmurdo rose to his feet for an instant <fullstop> i would say <comma> eminent
 bodymaster <comma> that if a man should be wanted i should take it as an
 honour to be chosen to help the lodge <fullstop>
 there was great applause at this <fullstop> it was felt that a new sun was
 pushing its rim above the horizon <fullstop> to some of the elders it seemed
 that the progress was a little too rapid <fullstop>
 i would move <comma> said the secretary <comma> harraway <comma> a vulture-faced old
 graybeard who sat near the chairman <comma> that brother mcmurdo should
 wait until it is the good pleasure of the lodge to employ him <fullstop>
 sure <comma> that was what i meant im in your hands <comma> said mcmurdo <fullstop>
 your time will come <comma> brother <comma> said the chairman <fullstop> we have marked
 you down as a willing man <comma> and we believe that you will do good work
 take a hand if it so please you <fullstop>
 i will wait for something that is worth while <fullstop>
 you can come to-night <comma> anyhow <comma> and it will help you to know what we
 stand for in this community <fullstop> i will make the announcement later <fullstop>
 meanwhile <comma> he glanced at his agenda paper <comma> i have one or two more
 points to bring before the meeting <fullstop> first of all <comma> i will ask the
 treasurer as to our bank balance <fullstop> there is the pension to jim
 carnaways widow <fullstop> he was struck down doing the work of the lodge <comma> and
 it is for us to see that she is not the loser <fullstop>
 jim was shot last month when they tried to kill chester wilcox of
 marley creek <comma> mcmurdos neighbour informed him <fullstop>
 the funds are good at the moment <comma> said the treasurer <comma> with the
 bankbook in front of him <fullstop> the firms have been generous of late <fullstop> max
 linder co <fullstop> paid five hundred to be left alone <fullstop> walker brothers sent
 in a hundred but i took it on myself to return it and ask for five <fullstop>
 if i do not hear by wednesday <comma> their winding gear may get out of
 order <fullstop> we had to burn their breaker last year before they became
 reasonable <fullstop> then the west section coaling company has paid its annual
 contribution <fullstop> we have enough on hand to meet any obligations <fullstop>
 what about archie swindon <question> asked a brother <fullstop>
 he has sold out and left the district <fullstop> the old devil left a note for
 us to say that he had rather be a free crossing sweeper in new york
 than a large mine owner under the power of a ring of blackmailers <fullstop> by
 gar it was as well that he made a break for it before the note
 reached us i guess he wont show his face in this valley again <fullstop>
 an elderly <comma> clean-shaved man with a kindly face and a good brow rose
 from the end of the table which faced the chairman <fullstop> mr <fullstop> treasurer <comma>
 he asked <comma> may i ask who has bought the property of this man that we
 have driven out of the district <question>
 yes <comma> brother morris <fullstop> it has been bought by the state merton county
 railroad company <fullstop>
 and who bought the mines of todman and of lee that came into the
 market in the same way last year <question>
 the same company <comma> brother morris <fullstop>
 and who bought the ironworks of manson and of shuman and of van
 deher and of atwood <comma> which have all been given up of late <question>
 they were all bought by the west gilmerton general mining company <fullstop>
 i dont see <comma> brother morris <comma> said the chairman <comma> that it matters to
 us who buys them <comma> since they cant carry them out of the district <fullstop>
 with all respect to you <comma> eminent bodymaster <comma> i think it may matter
 very much to us <fullstop> this process has been going on now for ten long
 years <fullstop> we are gradually driving all the small men out of trade <fullstop> what
 is the result <question> we find in their places great companies like the
 railroad or the general iron <comma> who have their directors in new york or
 philadelphia <comma> and care nothing for our threats <fullstop> we can take it out of
 their local bosses <comma> but it only means that others will be sent in
 their stead <fullstop> and we are making it dangerous for ourselves <fullstop> the small
 men could not harm us <fullstop> they had not the money nor the power <fullstop> so long
 as we did not squeeze them too dry <comma> they would stay on under our
 power <fullstop> but if these big companies find that we stand between them and
 their profits <comma> they will spare no pains and no expense to hunt us
 down and bring us to court <fullstop>
 there was a hush at these ominous words <comma> and every face darkened as
 gloomy looks were exchanged <fullstop> so omnipotent and unchallenged had they
 been that the very thought that there was possible retribution in the
 background had been banished from their minds <fullstop> and yet the idea
 struck a chill to the most reckless of them <fullstop>
 it is my advice <comma> the speaker continued <comma> that we go easier upon the
 small men <fullstop> on the day that they have all been driven out the power of
 this society will have been broken <fullstop>
 unwelcome truths are not popular <fullstop> there were angry cries as the
 speaker resumed his seat <fullstop> mcginty rose with gloom upon his brow <fullstop>
 brother morris <comma> said he <comma> you were always a croaker <fullstop> so long as the
 members of this lodge stand together there is no power in the united
 states that can touch them <fullstop> sure <comma> have we not tried it often enough
 in the law courts <question> i expect the big companies will find it easier to
 pay than to fight <comma> same as the little companies do <fullstop> and now <comma>
 brethren <comma> mcginty took off his black velvet cap and his stole as he
 spoke <comma> this lodge has finished its business for the evening <comma> save
 time has now come for fraternal refreshment and for harmony <fullstop>
 strange indeed is human nature <fullstop> here were these men <comma> to whom murder
 was familiar <comma> who again and again had struck down the father of the
 family <comma> some man against whom they had no personal feeling <comma> without
 one thought of compunction or of compassion for his weeping wife or
 helpless children <comma> and yet the tender or pathetic in music could move
 them to tears <fullstop> mcmurdo had a fine tenor voice <comma> and if he had failed
 to gain the good will of the lodge before <comma> it could no longer have
 been withheld after he had thrilled them with im sitting on the
 stile <comma> mary <comma> and on the banks of allan water <fullstop>
 in his very first night the new recruit had made himself one of the
 most popular of the brethren <comma> marked already for advancement and high
 office <fullstop> there were other qualities needed <comma> however <comma> besides those of
 good fellowship <comma> to make a worthy freeman <comma> and of these he was given
 an example before the evening was over <fullstop> the whisky bottle had passed
 round many times <comma> and the men were flushed and ripe for mischief when
 their bodymaster rose once more to address them <fullstop>
 boys <comma> said he <comma> theres one man in this town that wants trimming
 up <comma> and its for you to see that he gets it <fullstop> im speaking of james
 stanger of the herald <fullstop> youve seen how hes been opening his mouth
 against us again <question>
 there was a murmur of assent <comma> with many a muttered oath <fullstop> mcginty took
 a slip of paper from his waistcoat pocket <fullstop>
 law and order
 thats how he heads it <fullstop>
 reign of terror in the coal and iron district
 twelve years have now elapsed since the first assassinations which
 proved the existence of a criminal organization in our midst <fullstop> from
 that day these outrages have never ceased <comma> until now they have
 reached a pitch which makes us the opprobrium of the civilized world <fullstop>
 is it for such results as this that our great country welcomes to its
 bosom the alien who flies from the despotisms of europe <question> is it that
 they shall themselves become tyrants over the very men who have given
 them shelter <comma> and that a state of terrorism and lawlessness should be
 established under the very shadow of the sacred folds of the starry
 flag of freedom which would raise horror in our minds if we read of
 it as existing under the most effete monarchy of the east <question> the men
 are known <fullstop> the organization is patent and public <fullstop> how long are we to
 endure it <question> can we forever live--
 sure <comma> ive read enough of the slush cried the chairman <comma> tossing the
 paper down upon the table <fullstop> thats what he says of us <fullstop> the question
 im asking you is what shall we say to him <question>
 kill him cried a dozen fierce voices <fullstop>
 i protest against that <comma> said brother morris <comma> the man of the good
 brow and shaved face <fullstop> i tell you <comma> brethren <comma> that our hand is too
 heavy in this valley <comma> and that there will come a point where in
 self-defense every man will unite to crush us out <fullstop> james stanger is
 an old man <fullstop> he is respected in the township and the district <fullstop> his
 paper stands for all that is solid in the valley <fullstop> if that man is
 struck down <comma> there will be a stir through this state that will only
 end with our destruction <fullstop>
 and how would they bring about our destruction <comma> mr <fullstop> standback <question>
 cried mcginty <fullstop> is it by the police <question> sure <comma> half of them are in our
 pay and half of them afraid of us <fullstop> or is it by the law courts and the
 judge <question> havent we tried that before now <comma> and what ever came of it <question>
 there is a judge lynch that might try the case <comma> said brother
 morris <fullstop>
 a general shout of anger greeted the suggestion <fullstop>
 i have but to raise my finger <comma> cried mcginty <comma> and i could put two
 hundred men into this town that would clear it out from end to end <fullstop>
 then suddenly raising his voice and bending his huge black brows into
 a terrible frown <comma> see here <comma> brother morris <comma> i have my eye on you <comma>
 and have had for some time youve no heart yourself <comma> and you try to
 take the heart out of others <fullstop> it will be an ill day for you <comma> brother
 morris <comma> when your own name comes on our agenda paper <comma> and im
 thinking that its just there that i ought to place it <fullstop>
 morris had turned deadly pale <comma> and his knees seemed to give way under
 him as he fell back into his chair <fullstop> he raised his glass in his
 trembling hand and drank before he could answer <fullstop> i apologize <comma>
 eminent bodymaster <comma> to you and to every brother in this lodge if i
 have said more than i should <fullstop> i am a faithful member--you all know
 that--and it is my fear lest evil come to the lodge which makes me
 speak in anxious words <fullstop> but i have greater trust in your judgment
 than in my own <comma> eminent bodymaster <comma> and i promise you that i will not
 offend again <fullstop>
 the bodymasters scowl relaxed as he listened to the humble words <fullstop>
 very good <comma> brother morris <fullstop> its myself that would be sorry if it
 were needful to give you a lesson <fullstop> but so long as i am in this chair
 we shall be a united lodge in word and in deed <fullstop> and now <comma> boys <comma> he
 continued <comma> looking round at the company <comma> ill say this much <comma> that if
 stanger got his full deserts there would be more trouble than we need
 ask for <fullstop> these editors hang together <comma> and every journal in the state
 would be crying out for police and troops <fullstop> but i guess you can give
 him a pretty severe warning <fullstop> will you fix it <comma> brother baldwin <question>
 sure said the young man eagerly <fullstop>
 how many will you take <question>
 half a dozen <comma> and two to guard the door <fullstop> youll come <comma> gower <comma> and
 you <comma> mansel <comma> and you <comma> scanlan <comma> and the two willabys <fullstop>
 i promised the new brother he should go <comma> said the chairman <fullstop>
 ted baldwin looked at mcmurdo with eyes which showed that he had not
 forgotten nor forgiven <fullstop> well <comma> he can come if he wants <comma> he said in a
 surly voice <fullstop> thats enough <fullstop> the sooner we get to work the better <fullstop>
 the company broke up with shouts and yells and snatches of drunken
 song <fullstop> the bar was still crowded with revellers <comma> and many of the
 brethren remained there <fullstop> the little band who had been told off for
 duty passed out into the street <comma> proceeding in twos and threes along
 the sidewalk so as not to provoke attention <fullstop> it was a bitterly cold
 night <comma> with a half-moon shining brilliantly in a frosty <comma>
 star-spangled sky <fullstop> the men stopped and gathered in a yard which faced
 a high building <fullstop> the words vermissa herald were printed in gold
 lettering between the brightly lit windows <fullstop> from within came the
 clanking of the printing press <fullstop>
 here <comma> you <comma> said baldwin to mcmurdo <comma> you can stand below at the
 door and see that the road is kept open for us <fullstop> arthur willaby can
 stay with you <fullstop> you others come with me <fullstop> have no fears <comma> boys for we
 have a dozen witnesses that we are in the union bar at this very
 moment <fullstop>
 it was nearly midnight <comma> and the street was deserted save for one or
 pushing open the door of the newspaper office <comma> baldwin and his men
 rushed in and up the stair which faced them <fullstop> mcmurdo and another
 remained below <fullstop> from the room above came a shout <comma> a cry for help <comma> and
 then the sound of trampling feet and of falling chairs <fullstop> an instant
 later a gray-haired man rushed out on the landing <fullstop>
 he was seized before he could get farther <comma> and his spectacles came
 tinkling down to mcmurdos feet <fullstop> there was a thud and a groan <fullstop> he was
 on his face <comma> and half a dozen sticks were clattering together as they
 fell upon him <fullstop> he writhed <comma> and his long <comma> thin limbs quivered under
 the blows <fullstop> the others ceased at last but baldwin <comma> his cruel face set
 in an infernal smile <comma> was hacking at the mans head <comma> which he vainly
 endeavoured to defend with his arms <fullstop> his white hair was dabbled with
 patches of blood <fullstop> baldwin was still stooping over his victim <comma> putting
 mcmurdo dashed up the stair and pushed him back <fullstop>
 youll kill the man <comma> said he <fullstop> drop it
 baldwin looked at him in amazement <fullstop> curse you he cried <fullstop> who are
 you to interfere--you that are new to the lodge <question> stand back he
 raised his stick but mcmurdo had whipped his pistol out of his hip
 pocket <fullstop>
 stand back yourself he cried <fullstop> ill blow your face in if you lay a
 hand on me <fullstop> as to the lodge <comma> wasnt it the order of the bodymaster
 that the man was not to be killed--and what are you doing but killing
 him <question>
 its truth he says <comma> remarked one of the men <fullstop>
 by gar youd best hurry yourselves cried the man below <fullstop> the
 windows are all lighting up <comma> and youll have the whole town here
 inside of five minutes <fullstop>
 there was indeed the sound of shouting in the street <comma> and a little
 group of compositors and pressmen was forming in the hall below and
 nerving itself to action <fullstop> leaving the limp and motionless body of the
 editor at the head of the stair <comma> the criminals rushed down and made
 their way swiftly along the street <fullstop> having reached the union house <comma>
 some of them mixed with the crowd in mcgintys saloon <comma> whispering
 across the bar to the boss that the job had been well carried
 through <fullstop> others <comma> and among them mcmurdo <comma> broke away into side
 streets <comma> and so by devious paths to their own homes <fullstop>
 the valley of fear
 when mcmurdo awoke next morning he had good reason to remember his
 initiation into the lodge <fullstop> his head ached with the effect of the
 drink <comma> and his arm <comma> where he had been branded <comma> was hot and swollen <fullstop>
 having his own peculiar source of income <comma> he was irregular in his
 attendance at his work so he had a late breakfast <comma> and remained at
 home for the morning writing a long letter to a friend <fullstop> afterwards he
 read the daily herald <fullstop> in a special column put in at the last moment
 he read
 outrage at the herald office -- editor seriously injured
 it was a short account of the facts with which he was himself more
 familiar than the writer could have been <fullstop> it ended with the
 statement
 the matter is now in the hands of the police but it can hardly be
 hoped that their exertions will be attended by any better results
 than in the past <fullstop> some of the men were recognized <comma> and there is hope
 that a conviction may be obtained <fullstop> the source of the outrage was <comma> it
 need hardly be said <comma> that infamous society which has held this
 community in bondage for so long a period <comma> and against which the
 herald has taken so uncompromising a stand <fullstop> mr <fullstop> stangers many
 friends will rejoice to hear that <comma> though he has been cruelly and
 brutally beaten <comma> and though he has sustained severe injuries about
 the head <comma> there is no immediate danger to his life <fullstop>
 below it stated that a guard of police <comma> armed with winchester rifles <comma>
 had been requisitioned for the defense of the office <fullstop>
 mcmurdo had laid down the paper <comma> and was lighting his pipe with a
 hand which was shaky from the excesses of the previous evening <comma> when
 there was a knock outside <comma> and his landlady brought to him a note
 which had just been handed in by a lad <fullstop> it was unsigned <comma> and ran
 thus
 i should wish to speak to you <comma> but would rather not do so in your
 house <fullstop> you will find me beside the flagstaff upon miller hill <fullstop> if you
 will come there now <comma> i have something which it is important for you
 to hear and for me to say <fullstop>
 mcmurdo read the note twice with the utmost surprise for he could
 not imagine what it meant or who was the author of it <fullstop> had it been in
 a feminine hand <comma> he might have imagined that it was the beginning of
 one of those adventures which had been familiar enough in his past
 life <fullstop> but it was the writing of a man <comma> and of a well educated one <comma>
 too <fullstop> finally <comma> after some hesitation <comma> he determined to see the matter
 through <fullstop>
 miller hill is an ill-kept public park in the very centre of the
 town <fullstop> in summer it is a favourite resort of the people but in winter
 it is desolate enough <fullstop> from the top of it one has a view not only of
 the whole straggling <comma> grimy town <comma> but of the winding valley beneath <comma>
 with its scattered mines and factories blackening the snow on each
 side of it <comma> and of the wooded and white-capped ranges flanking it <fullstop>
 mcmurdo strolled up the winding path hedged in with evergreens until
 he reached the deserted restaurant which forms the centre of summer
 gaiety <fullstop> beside it was a bare flagstaff <comma> and underneath it a man <comma> his
 hat drawn down and the collar of his overcoat turned up <fullstop> when he
 turned his face mcmurdo saw that it was brother morris <comma> he who had
 incurred the anger of the bodymaster the night before <fullstop> the lodge sign
 was given and exchanged as they met <fullstop>
 i wanted to have a word with you <comma> mr <fullstop> mcmurdo <comma> said the older man <comma>
 speaking with a hesitation which showed that he was on delicate
 ground <fullstop> it was kind of you to come <fullstop>
 why did you not put your name to the note <question>
 one has to be cautious <comma> mister <fullstop> one never knows in times like these
 how a thing may come back to one <fullstop> one never knows either who to trust
 or who not to trust <fullstop>
 surely one may trust brothers of the lodge <fullstop>
 no <comma> no <comma> not always <comma> cried morris with vehemence <fullstop> whatever we say <comma>
 even what we think <comma> seems to go back to that man mcginty <fullstop>
 look here said mcmurdo sternly <fullstop> it was only last night <comma> as you
 know well <comma> that i swore good faith to our bodymaster <fullstop> would you be
 asking me to break my oath <question>
 if that is the view you take <comma> said morris sadly <comma> i can only say
 that i am sorry i gave you the trouble to come and meet me <fullstop> things
 have come to a bad pass when two free citizens cannot speak their
 thoughts to each other <fullstop>
 mcmurdo <comma> who had been watching his companion very narrowly <comma> relaxed
 somewhat in his bearing <fullstop> sure i spoke for myself only <comma> said he <fullstop> i
 am a newcomer <comma> as you know <comma> and i am strange to it all <fullstop> it is not for
 me to open my mouth <comma> mr <fullstop> morris <comma> and if you think well to say
 anything to me i am here to hear it <fullstop>
 and to take it back to boss mcginty said morris bitterly <fullstop>
 indeed <comma> then <comma> you do me injustice there <comma> cried mcmurdo <fullstop> for myself
 i am loyal to the lodge <comma> and so i tell you straight but i would be a
 poor creature if i were to repeat to any other what you might say to
 me in confidence <fullstop> it will go no further than me though i warn you
 that you may get neither help nor sympathy <fullstop>
 i have given up looking for either the one or the other <comma> said
 morris <fullstop> i may be putting my very life in your hands by what i say
 but <comma> bad as you are--and it seemed to me last night that you were
 shaping to be as bad as the worst--still you are new to it <comma> and your
 conscience cannot yet be as hardened as theirs <fullstop> that was why i
 thought to speak with you <fullstop>
 well <comma> what have you to say <question>
 if you give me away <comma> may a curse be on you
 sure <comma> i said i would not <fullstop>
 i would ask you <comma> then <comma> when you joined the freemans society in
 chicago and swore vows of charity and fidelity <comma> did ever it cross
 your mind that you might find it would lead you to crime <question>
 if you call it crime <comma> mcmurdo answered <fullstop>
 call it crime cried morris <comma> his voice vibrating with passion <fullstop> you
 have seen little of it if you can call it anything else <fullstop> was it crime
 last night when a man old enough to be your father was beaten till
 the blood dripped from his white hairs <question> was that crime--or what else
 would you call it <question>
 there are some would say it was war <comma> said mcmurdo <comma> a war of two
 classes with all in <comma> so that each struck as best it could <fullstop>
 well <comma> did you think of such a thing when you joined the freemans
 society at chicago <question>
 no <comma> im bound to say i did not <fullstop>
 nor did i when i joined it at philadelphia <fullstop> it was just a benefit
 club and a meeting place for ones fellows <fullstop> then i heard of this
 place--curse the hour that the name first fell upon my ears--and i
 came to better myself my god to better myself my wife and three
 children came with me <fullstop> i started a dry goods store on market square <comma>
 and i prospered well <fullstop> the word had gone round that i was a freeman <comma>
 and i was forced to join the local lodge <comma> same as you did last night <fullstop>
 ive the badge of shame on my forearm and something worse branded on
 my heart <fullstop> i found that i was under the orders of a black villain and
 caught in a meshwork of crime <fullstop> what could i do <question> every word i said to
 make things better was taken as treason <comma> same as it was last night <fullstop> i
 cant get away for all i have in the world is in my store <fullstop> if i
 leave the society <comma> i know well that it means murder to me <comma> and god
 knows what to my wife and children <fullstop> oh <comma> man <comma> it is awful--awful he
 put his hands to his face <comma> and his body shook with convulsive sobs <fullstop>
 mcmurdo shrugged his shoulders <fullstop> you were too soft for the job <comma> said
 he <fullstop> you are the wrong sort for such work <fullstop>
 i had a conscience and a religion but they made me a criminal among
 them <fullstop> i was chosen for a job <fullstop> if i backed down i knew well what would
 come to me <fullstop> maybe im a coward <fullstop> maybe its the thought of my poor
 little woman and the children that makes me one <fullstop> anyhow i went <fullstop> i
 guess it will haunt me forever <fullstop>
 it was a lonely house <comma> twenty miles from here <comma> over the range
 yonder <fullstop> i was told off for the door <comma> same as you were last night <fullstop>
 they could not trust me with the job <fullstop> the others went in <fullstop> when they
 came out their hands were crimson to the wrists <fullstop> as we turned away a
 child was screaming out of the house behind us <fullstop> it was a boy of five
 who had seen his father murdered <fullstop> i nearly fainted with the horror of
 it <comma> and yet i had to keep a bold and smiling face for well i knew
 that if i did not it would be out of my house that they would come
 next with their bloody hands and it would be my little fred that
 would be screaming for his father <fullstop>
 this world <comma> and lost also in the next <fullstop> i am a good catholic but the
 priest would have no word with me when he heard i was a scowrer <comma> and
 i am excommunicated from my faith <fullstop> thats how it stands with me <fullstop> and
 i see you going down the same road <comma> and i ask you what the end is to
 be <fullstop> are you ready to be a cold-blooded murderer also <comma> or can we do
 anything to stop it <question>
 what would you do <question> asked mcmurdo abruptly <fullstop> you would not inform <question>
 god forbid cried morris <fullstop> sure <comma> the very thought would cost me my
 life <fullstop>
 thats well <comma> said mcmurdo <fullstop> im thinking that you are a weak man
 and that you make too much of the matter <fullstop>
 too much wait till you have lived here longer <fullstop> look down the
 valley see the cloud of a hundred chimneys that overshadows it i
 tell you that the cloud of murder hangs thicker and lower than that
 over the heads of the people <fullstop> it is the valley of fear <comma> the valley of
 death <fullstop> the terror is in the hearts of the people from the dusk to the
 dawn <fullstop> wait <comma> young man <comma> and you will learn for yourself <fullstop>
 well <comma> ill let you know what i think when i have seen more <comma> said
 mcmurdo carelessly <fullstop> what is very clear is that you are not the man
 for the place <comma> and that the sooner you sell out--if you only get a
 dime a dollar for what the business is worth--the better it will be
 for you <fullstop> what you have said is safe with me but <comma> by gar if i
 thought you were an informer--
 no <comma> no cried morris piteously <fullstop>
 well <comma> let it rest at that <fullstop> ill bear what you have said in mind <comma> and
 maybe some day ill come back to it <fullstop> i expect you meant kindly by
 speaking to me like this <fullstop> now ill be getting home <fullstop>
 one word before you go <comma> said morris <fullstop> we may have been seen
 together <fullstop> they may want to know what we have spoken about <fullstop>
 ah thats well thought of <fullstop>
 i offer you a clerkship in my store <fullstop>
 and i refuse it <fullstop> thats our business <fullstop> well <comma> so long <comma> brother morris <comma>
 and may you find things go better with you in the future <fullstop>
 that same afternoon <comma> as mcmurdo sat smoking <comma> lost in thought beside
 the stove of his sitting-room <comma> the door swung open and its framework
 was filled with the huge figure of boss mcginty <fullstop> he passed the sign <comma>
 and then seating himself opposite to the young man he looked at him
 steadily for some time <comma> a look which was as steadily returned <fullstop>
 im not much of a visitor <comma> brother mcmurdo <comma> he said at last <fullstop> i
 guess i am too busy over the folk that visit me <fullstop> but i thought id
 stretch a point and drop down to see you in your own house <fullstop>
 im proud to see you here <comma> councillor <comma> mcmurdo answered heartily <comma>
 bringing his whisky bottle out of the cupboard <fullstop> its an honour that
 i had not expected <fullstop>
 hows the arm <question> asked the boss <fullstop>
 mcmurdo made a wry face <fullstop> well <comma> im not forgetting it <comma> he said but
 its worth it <fullstop>
 yes <comma> its worth it <comma> the other answered <comma> to those that are loyal
 and go through with it and are a help to the lodge <fullstop> what were you
 speaking to brother morris about on miller hill this morning <question>
 the question came so suddenly that it was well that he had his answer
 prepared <fullstop> he burst into a hearty laugh <fullstop> morris didnt know i could
 earn a living here at home <fullstop> he shant know either for he has got too
 much conscience for the likes of me <fullstop> but hes a good-hearted old
 chap <fullstop> it was his idea that i was at a loose end <comma> and that he would do
 me a good turn by offering me a clerkship in a dry goods store <fullstop>
 oh <comma> that was it <question>
 yes <comma> that was it <fullstop>
 and you refused it <question>
 sure <fullstop> couldnt i earn ten times as much in my own bedroom with four
 hours work <question>
 thats so <fullstop> but i wouldnt get about too much with morris <fullstop>
 why not <question>
 well <comma> i guess because i tell you not <fullstop> thats enough for most folk in
 it may be enough for most folk but it aint enough for me <comma>
 councillor <comma> said mcmurdo boldly <fullstop> if you are a judge of men <comma> youll
 know that <fullstop>
 the swarthy giant glared at him <comma> and his hairy paw closed for an
 instant round the glass as though he would hurl it at the head of his
 companion <fullstop> then he laughed in his loud <comma> boisterous <comma> insincere
 fashion <fullstop>
 youre a queer card <comma> for sure <comma> said he <fullstop> well <comma> if you want reasons <comma>
 ill give them <fullstop> did morris say nothing to you against the lodge <question>
 no <fullstop>
 nor against me <question>
 no <fullstop>
 well <comma> thats because he darent trust you <fullstop> but in his heart he is
 not a loyal brother <fullstop> we know that well <fullstop> so we watch him and we wait
 for the time to admonish him <fullstop> im thinking that the time is drawing
 near <fullstop> theres no room for scabby sheep in our pen <fullstop> but if you keep
 company with a disloyal man <comma> we might think that you were disloyal <comma>
 too <fullstop> see <question>
 theres no chance of my keeping company with him for i dislike the
 man <comma> mcmurdo answered <fullstop> as to being disloyal <comma> if it was any man but
 you he would not use the word to me twice <fullstop>
 well <comma> thats enough <comma> said mcginty <comma> draining off his glass <fullstop> i came
 down to give you a word in season <comma> and youve had it <fullstop>
 id like to know <comma> said mcmurdo <comma> how you ever came to learn that i
 had spoken with morris at all <question>
 mcginty laughed <fullstop> its my business to know what goes on in this
 township <comma> said he <fullstop> i guess youd best reckon on my hearing all that
 passes <fullstop> well <comma> times up <comma> and ill just say--
 but his leavetaking was cut short in a very unexpected fashion <fullstop> with
 a sudden crash the door flew open <comma> and three frowning <comma> intent faces
 glared in at them from under the peaks of police caps <fullstop> mcmurdo sprang
 to his feet and half drew his revolver but his arm stopped midway as
 he became conscious that two winchester rifles were levelled at his
 head <fullstop> a man in uniform advanced into the room <comma> a six-shooter in his
 hand <fullstop> it was captain marvin <comma> once of chicago <comma> and now of the mine
 constabulary <fullstop> he shook his head with a half-smile at mcmurdo <fullstop>
 i thought youd be getting into trouble <comma> mr <fullstop> crooked mcmurdo of
 chicago <comma> said he <fullstop> cant keep out of it <comma> can you <question> take your hat and
 come along with us <fullstop>
 i guess youll pay for this <comma> captain marvin <comma> said mcginty <fullstop> who are
 you <comma> id like to know <comma> to break into a house in this fashion and
 molest honest <comma> law-abiding men <question>
 youre standing out in this deal <comma> councillor mcginty <comma> said the
 police captain <fullstop> we are not out after you <comma> but after this man
 mcmurdo <fullstop> it is for you to help <comma> not to hinder us in our duty <comma>
 he is a friend of mine <comma> and ill answer for his conduct <comma> said the
 boss <fullstop>
 by all accounts <comma> mr <fullstop> mcginty <comma> you may have to answer for your own
 conduct some of these days <comma> the captain answered <fullstop> this man mcmurdo
 was a crook before ever he came here <comma> and hes a crook still <fullstop> cover
 him <comma> patrolman <comma> while i disarm him <fullstop>
 theres my pistol <comma> said mcmurdo coolly <fullstop> maybe <comma> captain marvin <comma> if
 you and i were alone and face to face you would not take me so
 easily <fullstop>
 wheres your warrant <question> asked mcginty <fullstop> by gar a man might as well
 live in russia as in vermissa while folk like you are running the
 police <fullstop> its a capitalist outrage <comma> and youll hear more of it <comma> i
 reckon <fullstop>
 you do what you think is your duty the best way you can <comma> councillor <fullstop>
 well look after ours <fullstop>
 what am i accused of <question> asked mcmurdo <fullstop>
 of being concerned in the beating of old editor stanger at the
 herald office <fullstop> it wasnt your fault that it isnt a murder charge <fullstop>
 well <comma> if thats all you have against him <comma> cried mcginty with a
 laugh <comma> you can save yourself a deal of trouble by dropping it right
 now <fullstop> this man was with me in my saloon playing poker up to midnight <comma>
 and i can bring a dozen to prove it <fullstop>
 thats your affair <comma> and i guess you can settle it in court
 to-morrow <fullstop> meanwhile <comma> come on <comma> mcmurdo <comma> and come quietly if you dont
 want a gun across your head <fullstop> you stand wide <comma> mr <fullstop> mcginty for i warn
 you i will stand no resistance when i am on duty
 so determined was the appearance of the captain that both mcmurdo and
 his boss were forced to accept the situation <fullstop> the latter managed to
 what about-- he jerked his thumb upward to signify the coining
 plant <fullstop>
 all right <comma> whispered mcmurdo <comma> who had devised a safe hiding place
 under the floor <fullstop>
 ill bid you good-bye <comma> said the boss <comma> shaking hands <fullstop> ill see
 reilly the lawyer and take the defense upon myself <fullstop> take my word for
 it that they wont be able to hold you <fullstop>
 i wouldnt bet on that <fullstop> guard the prisoner <comma> you two <comma> and shoot him
 if he tries any games <fullstop> ill search the house before i leave <fullstop>
 he did so but apparently found no trace of the concealed plant <fullstop> when
 he had descended he and his men escorted mcmurdo to headquarters <fullstop>
 darkness had fallen <comma> and a keen blizzard was blowing so that the
 streets were nearly deserted but a few loiterers followed the group <comma>
 and emboldened by invisibility shouted imprecations at the prisoner <fullstop>
 lynch the cursed scowrer they cried <fullstop> lynch him they laughed and
 jeered as he was pushed into the police station <fullstop> after a short <comma>
 formal examination from the inspector in charge he was put into the
 common cell <fullstop> here he found baldwin and three other criminals of the
 night before <comma> all arrested that afternoon and waiting their trial
 next morning <fullstop>
 but even within this inner fortress of the law the long arm of the
 freemen was able to extend <fullstop> late at night there came a jailer with a
 straw bundle for their bedding <comma> out of which he extracted two bottles
 of whisky <comma> some glasses <comma> and a pack of cards <fullstop> they spent a hilarious
 night <comma> without an anxious thought as to the ordeal of the morning <fullstop>
 nor had they cause <comma> as the result was to show <fullstop> the magistrate could
 not possibly <comma> on the evidence <comma> have held them for a higher court <fullstop> on
 the one hand the compositors and pressmen were forced to admit that
 the light was uncertain <comma> that they were themselves much perturbed <comma>
 and that it was difficult for them to swear to the identity of the
 assailants although they believed that the accused were among them <fullstop>
 cross examined by the clever attorney who had been engaged by
 mcginty <comma> they were even more nebulous in their evidence <fullstop>
 the injured man had already deposed that he was so taken by surprise
 by the suddenness of the attack that he could state nothing beyond
 the fact that the first man who struck him wore a moustache <fullstop> he added
 that he knew them to be scowrers <comma> since no one else in the community
 could possibly have any enmity to him <comma> and he had long been
 threatened on account of his outspoken editorials <fullstop> on the other hand <comma>
 it was clearly shown by the united and unfaltering evidence of six
 citizens <comma> including that high municipal official <comma> councillor mcginty <comma>
 hour very much later than the commission of the outrage <fullstop>
 needless to say that they were discharged with something very near to
 an apology from the bench for the inconvenience to which they had
 been put <comma> together with an implied censure of captain marvin and the
 police for their officious zeal <fullstop>
 the verdict was greeted with loud applause by a court in which
 mcmurdo saw many familiar faces <fullstop> brothers of the lodge smiled and
 waved <fullstop> but there were others who sat with compressed lips and
 brooding eyes as the men filed out of the dock <fullstop> one of them <comma> a
 little <comma> dark-bearded <comma> resolute fellow <comma> put the thoughts of himself
 and comrades into words as the ex-prisoners passed him <fullstop>
 you damned murderers he said <fullstop> well fix you yet
 the darkest hour
 if anything had been needed to give an impetus to jack mcmurdos
 popularity among his fellows it would have been his arrest and
 acquittal <fullstop> that a man on the very night of joining the lodge should
 have done something which brought him before the magistrate was a new
 record in the annals of the society <fullstop> already he had earned the
 reputation of a good boon companion <comma> a cheery reveller <comma> and withal a
 man of high temper <comma> who would not take an insult even from the
 all-powerful boss himself <fullstop> but in addition to this he impressed his
 comrades with the idea that among them all there was not one whose
 brain was so ready to devise a bloodthirsty scheme <comma> or whose hand
 would be more capable of carrying it out <fullstop> hell be the boy for the
 clean job <comma> said the oldsters to one another <comma> and waited their time
 until they could set him to his work <fullstop>
 mcginty had instruments enough already but he recognized that this
 was a supremely able one <fullstop> he felt like a man holding a fierce
 bloodhound in leash <fullstop> there were curs to do the smaller work but some
 day he would slip this creature upon its prey <fullstop> a few members of the
 lodge <comma> ted baldwin among them <comma> resented the rapid rise of the
 stranger and hated him for it but they kept clear of him <comma> for he was
 as ready to fight as to laugh <fullstop>
 but if he gained favour with his fellows <comma> there was another quarter <comma>
 one which had become even more vital to him <comma> in which he lost it <fullstop>
 ettie shafters father would have nothing more to do with him <comma> nor
 would he allow him to enter the house <fullstop> ettie herself was too deeply
 in love to give him up altogether <comma> and yet her own good sense warned
 her of what would come from a marriage with a man who was regarded as
 a criminal <fullstop>
 one morning after a sleepless night she determined to see him <comma>
 possibly for the last time <comma> and make one strong endeavour to draw him
 from those evil influences which were sucking him down <fullstop> she went to
 his house <comma> as he had often begged her to do <comma> and made her way into
 the room which he used as his sitting-room <fullstop> he was seated at a table <comma>
 with his back turned and a letter in front of him <fullstop> a sudden spirit of
 girlish mischief came over her--she was still only nineteen <fullstop> he had
 not heard her when she pushed open the door <fullstop> now she tiptoed forward
 and laid her hand lightly upon his bended shoulders <fullstop>
 if she had expected to startle him <comma> she certainly succeeded but only
 in turn to be startled herself <fullstop> with a tiger spring he turned on her <comma>
 and his right hand was feeling for her throat <fullstop> at the same instant
 with the other hand he crumpled up the paper that lay before him <fullstop> for
 an instant he stood glaring <fullstop> then astonishment and joy took the place
 of the ferocity which had convulsed his features--a ferocity which
 had sent her shrinking back in horror as from something which had
 never before intruded into her gentle life <fullstop>
 its you said he <comma> mopping his brow <fullstop> and to think that you should
 come to me <comma> heart of my heart <comma> and i should find nothing better to do
 than to want to strangle you come then <comma> darling <comma> and he held out
 his arms <comma> let me make it up to you <fullstop>
 but she had not recovered from that sudden glimpse of guilty fear
 which she had read in the mans face <fullstop> all her womans instinct told
 her that it was not the mere fright of a man who is startled <fullstop>
 guilt--that was it--guilt and fear
 whats come over you <comma> jack <question> she cried <fullstop> why were you so scared of
 me <question> oh <comma> jack <comma> if your conscience was at ease <comma> you would not have
 looked at me like that
 sure <comma> i was thinking of other things <comma> and when you came tripping so
 lightly on those fairy feet of yours--
 no <comma> no <comma> it was more than that <comma> jack <fullstop> then a sudden suspicion seized
 her <fullstop> let me see that letter you were writing <fullstop>
 ah <comma> ettie <comma> i couldnt do that <fullstop>
 her suspicions became certainties <fullstop> its to another woman <comma> she
 cried <fullstop> i know it why else should you hold it from me <question> was it to
 your wife that you were writing <question> how am i to know that you are not a
 married man--you <comma> a stranger <comma> that nobody knows <question>
 i am not married <comma> ettie <fullstop> see now <comma> i swear it youre the only one
 woman on earth to me <fullstop> by the cross of christ i swear it
 he was so white with passionate earnestness that she could not but
 believe him <fullstop>
 well <comma> then <comma> she cried <comma> why will you not show me the letter <question>
 ill tell you <comma> acushla <comma> said he <fullstop> im under oath not to show it <comma>
 and just as i wouldnt break my word to you so i would keep it to
 those who hold my promise <fullstop> its the business of the lodge <comma> and even
 to you its secret <fullstop> and if i was scared when a hand fell on me <comma> cant
 you understand it when it might have been the hand of a detective <question>
 she felt that he was telling the truth <fullstop> he gathered her into his arms
 and kissed away her fears and doubts <fullstop>
 sit here by me <comma> then <fullstop> its a queer throne for such a queen but its
 the best your poor lover can find <fullstop> hell do better for you some of
 these days <comma> im thinking <fullstop> now your mind is easy once again <comma> is it
 not <question>
 how can it ever be at ease <comma> jack <comma> when i know that you are a
 criminal among criminals <comma> when i never know the day that i may hear
 you are in court for murder <question> mcmurdo the scowrer <comma> thats what one
 of our boarders called you yesterday <fullstop> it went through my heart like a
 knife <fullstop>
 sure <comma> hard words break no bones <fullstop>
 but they were true <fullstop>
 well <comma> dear <comma> its not so bad as you think <fullstop> we are but poor men that
 are trying in our own way to get our rights <fullstop>
 ettie threw her arms round her lovers neck <fullstop> give it up <comma> jack for
 my sake <comma> for gods sake <comma> give it up it was to ask you that i came
 here to-day <fullstop> oh <comma> jack <comma> see--i beg it of you on my bended knees
 kneeling here before you i implore you to give it up
 he raised her and soothed her with her head against his breast <fullstop>
 sure <comma> my darlin <comma> you dont know what it is you are asking <fullstop> how
 could i give it up when it would be to break my oath and to desert my
 comrades <question> if you could see how things stand with me you could never
 ask it of me <fullstop> besides <comma> if i wanted to <comma> how could i do it <question> you dont
 suppose that the lodge would let a man go free with all its secrets <question>
 ive thought of that <comma> jack <fullstop> ive planned it all <fullstop> father has saved
 some money <fullstop> he is weary of this place where the fear of these people
 darkens our lives <fullstop> he is ready to go <fullstop> we would fly together to
 philadelphia or new york <comma> where we would be safe from them <fullstop>
 mcmurdo laughed <fullstop> the lodge has a long arm <fullstop> do you think it could not
 stretch from here to philadelphia or new york <question>
 well <comma> then <comma> to the west <comma> or to england <comma> or to germany <comma> where father
 came from--anywhere to get away from this valley of fear
 mcmurdo thought of old brother morris <fullstop> sure <comma> it is the second time i
 have heard the valley so named <comma> said he <fullstop> the shadow does indeed
 seem to lie heavy on some of you <fullstop>
 it darkens every moment of our lives <fullstop> do you suppose that ted
 baldwin has ever forgiven us <question> if it were not that he fears you <comma> what
 do you suppose our chances would be <question> if you saw the look in those
 dark <comma> hungry eyes of his when they fall on me
 by gar id teach him better manners if i caught him at it but see
 here <comma> little girl <fullstop> i cant leave here <fullstop> i cant--take that from me
 once and for all <fullstop> but if you will leave me to find my own way <comma> i will
 try to prepare a way of getting honourably out of it <fullstop>
 there is no honour in such a matter <fullstop>
 well <comma> well <comma> its just how you look at it <fullstop> but if youll give me six
 months <comma> ill work it so that i can leave without being ashamed to
 look others in the face <fullstop>
 the girl laughed with joy <fullstop> six months she cried <fullstop> is it a
 promise <question>
 well <comma> it may be seven or eight <fullstop> but within a year at the furthest we
 will leave the valley behind us <fullstop>
 it was the most that ettie could obtain <comma> and yet it was something <fullstop>
 there was this distant light to illuminate the gloom of the immediate
 future <fullstop> she returned to her fathers house more light-hearted than
 she had ever been since jack mcmurdo had come into her life <fullstop>
 it might be thought that as a member <comma> all the doings of the society
 would be told to him but he was soon to discover that the
 organization was wider and more complex than the simple lodge <fullstop> even
 boss mcginty was ignorant as to many things for there was an
 official named the county delegate <comma> living at hobsons patch farther
 down the line <comma> who had power over several different lodges which he
 wielded in a sudden and arbitrary way <fullstop> only once did mcmurdo see him <comma>
 a sly <comma> little gray-haired rat of a man <comma> with a slinking gait and a
 sidelong glance which was charged with malice <fullstop> evans pott was his
 name <comma> and even the great boss of vermissa felt towards him something
 of the repulsion and fear which the huge danton may have felt for the
 puny but dangerous robespierre <fullstop>
 one day scanlan <comma> who was mcmurdos fellow boarder <comma> received a note
 from mcginty inclosing one from evans pott <comma> which informed him that
 he was sending over two good men <comma> lawler and andrews <comma> who had
 instructions to act in the neighbourhood though it was best for the
 the bodymaster see to it that suitable arrangements be made for their
 lodgings and comfort until the time for action should arrive <question> mcginty
 added that it was impossible for anyone to remain secret at the union
 house <comma> and that <comma> therefore <comma> he would be obliged if mcmurdo and
 scanlan would put the strangers up for a few days in their boarding
 house <fullstop>
 the same evening the two men arrived <comma> each carrying his gripsack <fullstop>
 lawler was an elderly man <comma> shrewd <comma> silent <comma> and self-contained <comma> clad
 in an old black frock coat <comma> which with his soft felt hat and ragged <comma>
 grizzled beard gave him a general resemblance to an itinerant
 preacher <fullstop> his companion andrews was little more than a boy <comma>
 frank-faced and cheerful <comma> with the breezy manner of one who is out
 for a holiday and means to enjoy every minute of it <fullstop> both men were
 total abstainers <comma> and behaved in all ways as exemplary members of the
 society <comma> with the one simple exception that they were assassins who
 had often proved themselves to be most capable instruments for this
 association of murder <fullstop> lawler had already carried out fourteen
 commissions of the kind <comma> and andrews three <fullstop>
 they were <comma> as mcmurdo found <comma> quite ready to converse about their
 deeds in the past <comma> which they recounted with the half-bashful pride
 of men who had done good and unselfish service for the community <fullstop>
 they were reticent <comma> however <comma> as to the immediate job in hand <fullstop>
 they chose us because neither i nor the boy here drink <comma> lawler
 explained <fullstop> they can count on us saying no more than we should <fullstop> you
 must not take it amiss <comma> but it is the orders of the county delegate
 that we obey <fullstop>
 sure <comma> we are all in it together <comma> said scanlan <comma> mcmurdos mate <comma> as
 the four sat together at supper <fullstop>
 thats true enough <comma> and well talk till the cows come home of the
 killing of charlie williams or of simon bird <comma> or any other job in the
 past <fullstop> but till the work is done we say nothing <fullstop>
 there are half a dozen about here that i have a word to say to <comma>
 said mcmurdo <comma> with an oath <fullstop> i suppose it isnt jack knox of ironhill
 that you are after <fullstop> id go some way to see him get his deserts <fullstop>
 no <comma> its not him yet <fullstop>
 or herman strauss <question>
 no <comma> nor him either <fullstop>
 well <comma> if you wont tell us we cant make you but id be glad to
 know <fullstop>
 lawler smiled and shook his head <fullstop> he was not to be drawn <fullstop>
 in spite of the reticence of their guests <comma> scanlan and mcmurdo were
 quite determined to be present at what they called the fun <fullstop> when <comma>
 therefore <comma> at an early hour one morning mcmurdo heard them creeping
 down the stairs he awakened scanlan <comma> and the two hurried on their
 clothes <fullstop> when they were dressed they found that the others had stolen
 out <comma> leaving the door open behind them <fullstop> it was not yet dawn <comma> and by
 the light of the lamps they could see the two men some distance down
 the street <fullstop> they followed them warily <comma> treading noiselessly in the
 deep snow <fullstop>
 the boarding house was near the edge of the town <comma> and soon they were
 at the crossroads which is beyond its boundary <fullstop> here three men were
 waiting <comma> with whom lawler and andrews held a short <comma> eager
 conversation <fullstop> then they all moved on together <fullstop> it was clearly some
 notable job which needed numbers <fullstop> at this point there are several
 trails which lead to various mines <fullstop> the strangers took that which led
 to the crow hill <comma> a huge business which was in strong hands which had
 been able <comma> thanks to their energetic and fearless new england
 manager <comma> josiah h <fullstop> dunn <comma> to keep some order and discipline during the
 long reign of terror <fullstop>
 day was breaking now <comma> and a line of workmen were slowly making their
 way <comma> singly and in groups <comma> along the blackened path <fullstop>
 mcmurdo and scanlan strolled on with the others <comma> keeping in sight of
 the men whom they followed <fullstop> a thick mist lay over them <comma> and from the
 heart of it there came the sudden scream of a steam whistle <fullstop> it was
 the ten-minute signal before the cages descended and the days labour
 began <fullstop>
 when they reached the open space round the mine shaft there were a
 hundred miners waiting <comma> stamping their feet and blowing on their
 fingers for it was bitterly cold <fullstop> the strangers stood in a little
 group under the shadow of the engine house <fullstop> scanlan and mcmurdo
 climbed a heap of slag from which the whole scene lay before them <fullstop>
 they saw the mine engineer <comma> a great bearded scotchman named menzies <comma>
 come out of the engine house and blow his whistle for the cages to be
 lowered <fullstop>
 at the same instant a tall <comma> loose-framed young man with a
 clean-shaved <comma> earnest face advanced eagerly towards the pit head <fullstop> as
 he came forward his eyes fell upon the group <comma> silent and motionless <comma>
 under the engine house <fullstop> the men had drawn down their hats and turned
 up their collars to screen their faces <fullstop> for a moment the presentiment
 of death laid its cold hand upon the managers heart <fullstop> at the next he
 had shaken it off and saw only his duty towards intrusive strangers <fullstop>
 who are you <question> he asked as he advanced <fullstop> what are you loitering there
 for <question>
 there was no answer but the lad andrews stepped forward and shot him
 in the stomach <fullstop> the hundred waiting miners stood as motionless and
 helpless as if they were paralyzed <fullstop> the manager clapped his two hands
 to the wound and doubled himself up <fullstop> then he staggered away but
 another of the assassins fired <comma> and he went down sidewise <comma> kicking
 and clawing among a heap of clinkers <fullstop> menzies <comma> the scotchman <comma> gave a
 roar of rage at the sight and rushed with an iron spanner at the
 murderers but was met by two balls in the face which dropped him
 dead at their very feet <fullstop>
 there was a surge forward of some of the miners <comma> and an inarticulate
 cry of pity and of anger but a couple of the strangers emptied their
 six-shooters over the heads of the crowd <comma> and they broke and
 scattered <comma> some of them rushing wildly back to their homes in
 vermissa <fullstop>
 when a few of the bravest had rallied <comma> and there was a return to the
 mine <comma> the murderous gang had vanished in the mists of morning <comma>
 without a single witness being able to swear to the identity of these
 men who in front of a hundred spectators had wrought this double
 crime <fullstop>
 scanlan and mcmurdo made their way back scanlan somewhat subdued <comma>
 for it was the first murder job that he had seen with his own eyes <comma>
 and it appeared less funny than he had been led to believe <fullstop> the
 horrible screams of the dead managers wife pursued them as they
 hurried to the town <fullstop> mcmurdo was absorbed and silent but he showed
 no sympathy for the weakening of his companion <fullstop>
 sure <comma> it is like a war <comma> he repeated <fullstop> what is it but a war between
 us and them <comma> and we hit back where we best can <fullstop>
 there was high revel in the lodge room at the union house that night <comma>
 not only over the killing of the manager and engineer of the crow
 hill mine <comma> which would bring this organization into line with the
 other blackmailed and terror-stricken companies of the district <comma> but
 also over a distant triumph which had been wrought by the hands of
 the lodge itself <fullstop>
 it would appear that when the county delegate had sent over five good
 men to strike a blow in vermissa <comma> he had demanded that in return
 three vermissa men should be secretly selected and sent across to
 kill william hales of stake royal <comma> one of the best known and most
 popular mine owners in the gilmerton district <comma> a man who was believed
 not to have an enemy in the world for he was in all ways a model
 employer <fullstop> he had insisted <comma> however <comma> upon efficiency in the work <comma> and
 had <comma> therefore <comma> paid off certain drunken and idle employees who were
 members of the all-powerful society <fullstop> coffin notices hung outside his
 door had not weakened his resolution <comma> and so in a free <comma> civilized
 country he found himself condemned to death <fullstop>
 the execution had now been duly carried out <fullstop> ted baldwin <comma> who
 sprawled now in the seat of honour beside the bodymaster <comma> had been
 of sleeplessness and drink <fullstop> he and his two comrades had spent the
 night before among the mountains <fullstop> they were unkempt and
 weather-stained <fullstop> but no heroes <comma> returning from a forlorn hope <comma> could
 have had a warmer welcome from their comrades <fullstop>
 the story was told and retold amid cries of delight and shouts of
 laughter <fullstop> they had waited for their man as he drove home at
 nightfall <comma> taking their station at the top of a steep hill <comma> where his
 horse must be at a walk <fullstop> he was so furred to keep out the cold that
 he could not lay his hand on his pistol <fullstop> they had pulled him out and
 shot him again and again <fullstop> he had screamed for mercy <fullstop> the screams were
 repeated for the amusement of the lodge <fullstop>
 lets hear again how he squealed <comma> they cried <fullstop>
 none of them knew the man but there is eternal drama in a killing <comma>
 and they had shown the scowrers of gilmerton that the vermissa men
 were to be relied upon <fullstop>
 there had been one contretemps for a man and his wife had driven up
 while they were still emptying their revolvers into the silent body <fullstop>
 it had been suggested that they should shoot them both but they were
 harmless folk who were not connected with the mines <comma> so they were
 sternly bidden to drive on and keep silent <comma> lest a worse thing befall
 them <fullstop> and so the blood-mottled figure had been left as a warning to
 all such hard-hearted employers <comma> and the three noble avengers had
 hurried off into the mountains where unbroken nature comes down to
 the very edge of the furnaces and the slag heaps <fullstop> here they were <comma>
 safe and sound <comma> their work well done <comma> and the plaudits of their
 companions in their ears <fullstop>
 it had been a great day for the scowrers <fullstop> the shadow had fallen even
 darker over the valley <fullstop> but as the wise general chooses the moment of
 victory in which to redouble his efforts <comma> so that his foes may have
 no time to steady themselves after disaster <comma> so boss mcginty <comma> looking
 out upon the scene of his operations with his brooding and malicious
 eyes <comma> had devised a new attack upon those who opposed him <fullstop> that very
 night <comma> as the half-drunken company broke up <comma> he touched mcmurdo on
 the arm and led him aside into that inner room where they had their
 first interview <fullstop>
 see here <comma> my lad <comma> said he <comma> ive got a job thats worthy of you at
 last <fullstop> youll have the doing of it in your own hands <fullstop>
 proud i am to hear it <comma> mcmurdo answered <fullstop>
 you can take two men with you--manders and reilly <fullstop> they have been
 warned for service <fullstop> well never be right in this district until
 chester wilcox has been settled <comma> and youll have the thanks of every
 lodge in the coal fields if you can down him <fullstop>
 ill do my best <comma> anyhow <fullstop> who is he <comma> and where shall i find him <question>
 mcginty took his eternal half-chewed <comma> half-smoked cigar from the
 corner of his mouth <comma> and proceeded to draw a rough diagram on a page
 torn from his notebook <fullstop>
 hes the chief foreman of the iron dike company <fullstop> hes a hard
 citizen <comma> an old colour sergeant of the war <comma> all scars and grizzle <fullstop>
 weve had two tries at him but had no luck <comma> and jim carnaway lost
 his life over it <fullstop> now its for you to take it over <fullstop> thats the
 house--all alone at the iron dike crossroad <comma> same as you see here on
 the map--without another within earshot <fullstop> its no good by day <fullstop> hes
 armed and shoots quick and straight <comma> with no questions asked <fullstop> but at
 night--well <comma> there he is with his wife <comma> three children <comma> and a hired
 help <fullstop> you cant pick or choose <fullstop> its all or none <fullstop> if you could get a
 bag of blasting powder at the front door with a slow match to it--
 whats the man done <question>
 didnt i tell you he shot jim carnaway <question>
 why did he shoot him <question>
 what in thunder has that to do with you <question> carnaway was about his
 house at night <comma> and he shot him <fullstop> thats enough for me and you <fullstop> youve
 got to settle the thing right <fullstop>
 theres these two women and the children <fullstop> do they go up too <question>
 they have to--else how can we get him <question>
 it seems hard on them for theyve done nothing <fullstop>
 what sort of fools talk is this <question> do you back out <question>
 easy <comma> councillor <comma> easy what have i ever said or done that you
 should think i would be after standing back from an order of the
 bodymaster of my own lodge <question> if its right or if its wrong <comma> its for
 you to decide <fullstop>
 youll do it <comma> then <question>
 of course i will do it <fullstop>
 when <question>
 well <comma> you had best give me a night or two that i may see the house
 and make my plans <fullstop> then--
 very good <comma> said mcginty <comma> shaking him by the hand <fullstop> i leave it with
 you <fullstop> it will be a great day when you bring us the news <fullstop> its just the
 last stroke that will bring them all to their knees <fullstop>
 mcmurdo thought long and deeply over the commission which had been so
 suddenly placed in his hands <fullstop> the isolated house in which chester
 wilcox lived was about five miles off in an adjacent valley <fullstop> that
 very night he started off all alone to prepare for the attempt <fullstop> it
 was daylight before he returned from his reconnaissance <fullstop> next day he
 interviewed his two subordinates <comma> manders and reilly <comma> reckless
 youngsters who were as elated as if it were a deer-hunt <fullstop>
 two nights later they met outside the town <comma> all three armed <comma> and one
 of them carrying a sack stuffed with the powder which was used in the
 quarries <fullstop> it was two in the morning before they came to the lonely
 house <fullstop> the night was a windy one <comma> with broken clouds drifting swiftly
 across the face of a three-quarter moon <fullstop> they had been warned to be
 on their guard against bloodhounds so they moved forward cautiously <comma>
 with their pistols cocked in their hands <fullstop> but there was no sound save
 the howling of the wind <comma> and no movement but the swaying branches
 above them <fullstop>
 mcmurdo listened at the door of the lonely house but all was still
 within <fullstop> then he leaned the powder bag against it <comma> ripped a hole in it
 with his knife <comma> and attached the fuse <fullstop> when it was well alight he and
 his two companions took to their heels <comma> and were some distance off <comma>
 safe and snug in a sheltering ditch <comma> before the shattering roar of
 the explosion <comma> with the low <comma> deep rumble of the collapsing building <comma>
 told them that their work was done <fullstop> no cleaner job had ever been
 carried out in the bloodstained annals of the society <fullstop>
 but alas that work so well organized and boldly carried out should
 all have gone for nothing warned by the fate of the various victims <comma>
 and knowing that he was marked down for destruction <comma> chester wilcox
 had moved himself and his family only the day before to some safer
 and less known quarters <comma> where a guard of police should watch over
 them <fullstop> it was an empty house which had been torn down by the
 gunpowder <comma> and the grim old colour sergeant of the war was still
 teaching discipline to the miners of iron dike <fullstop>
 leave him to me <comma> said mcmurdo <fullstop> hes my man <comma> and ill get him sure
 if i have to wait a year for him <fullstop>
 a vote of thanks and confidence was passed in full lodge <comma> and so for
 the time the matter ended <fullstop> when a few weeks later it was reported in
 the papers that wilcox had been shot at from an ambuscade <comma> it was an
 open secret that mcmurdo was still at work upon his unfinished job <fullstop>
 such were the methods of the society of freemen <comma> and such were the
 deeds of the scowrers by which they spread their rule of fear over
 the great and rich district which was for so long a period haunted by
 their terrible presence <fullstop> why should these pages be stained by further
 crimes <question> have i not said enough to show the men and their methods <question>
 these deeds are written in history <comma> and there are records wherein one
 may read the details of them <fullstop> there one may learn of the shooting of
 policemen hunt and evans because they had ventured to arrest two
 members of the society--a double outrage planned at the vermissa
 lodge and carried out in cold blood upon two helpless and disarmed
 men <fullstop> there also one may read of the shooting of mrs <fullstop> larbey when she
 was nursing her husband <comma> who had been beaten almost to death by
 orders of boss mcginty <fullstop> the killing of the elder jenkins <comma> shortly
 followed by that of his brother <comma> the mutilation of james murdoch <comma> the
 blowing up of the staphouse family <comma> and the murder of the stendals
 all followed hard upon one another in the same terrible winter <fullstop>
 darkly the shadow lay upon the valley of fear <fullstop> the spring had come
 with running brooks and blossoming trees <fullstop> there was hope for all
 nature bound so long in an iron grip but nowhere was there any hope
 for the men and women who lived under the yoke of the terror <fullstop> never
 had the cloud above them been so dark and hopeless as in the early
 summer of the year 1875 <fullstop>
 danger
 it was the height of the reign of terror <fullstop> mcmurdo <comma> who had already
 been appointed inner deacon <comma> with every prospect of some day
 succeeding mcginty as bodymaster <comma> was now so necessary to the
 councils of his comrades that nothing was done without his help and
 advice <fullstop> the more popular he became <comma> however <comma> with the freemen <comma> the
 blacker were the scowls which greeted him as he passed along the
 streets of vermissa <fullstop> in spite of their terror the citizens were
 taking heart to band themselves together against their oppressors <fullstop>
 rumours had reached the lodge of secret gatherings in the herald
 office and of distribution of firearms among the law-abiding people <fullstop>
 but mcginty and his men were undisturbed by such reports <fullstop> they were
 numerous <comma> resolute <comma> and well armed <fullstop> their opponents were scattered
 and powerless <fullstop> it would all end <comma> as it had done in the past <comma> in
 aimless talk and possibly in impotent arrests <fullstop> so said mcginty <comma>
 mcmurdo <comma> and all the bolder spirits <fullstop>
 it was a saturday evening in may <fullstop> saturday was always the lodge
 night <comma> and mcmurdo was leaving his house to attend it when morris <comma>
 the weaker brother of the order <comma> came to see him <fullstop> his brow was
 creased with care <comma> and his kindly face was drawn and haggard <fullstop>
 can i speak with you freely <comma> mr <fullstop> mcmurdo <question>
 sure <fullstop>
 i cant forget that i spoke my heart to you once <comma> and that you kept
 it to yourself <comma> even though the boss himself came to ask you about
 it <fullstop>
 what else could i do if you trusted me <question> it wasnt that i agreed with
 what you said <fullstop>
 i know that well <fullstop> but you are the one that i can speak to and be
 safe <fullstop> ive a secret here <comma> he put his hand to his breast <comma> and it is
 just burning the life out of me <fullstop> i wish it had come to any one of you
 but me <fullstop> if i tell it <comma> it will mean murder <comma> for sure <fullstop> if i dont <comma> it
 may bring the end of us all <fullstop> god help me <comma> but i am near out of my
 wits over it
 mcmurdo looked at the man earnestly <fullstop> he was trembling in every limb <fullstop>
 he poured some whisky into a glass and handed it to him <fullstop> thats the
 physic for the likes of you <comma> said he <fullstop> now let me hear of it <fullstop>
 morris drank <comma> and his white face took a tinge of colour <fullstop> i can tell
 it to you all in one sentence <comma> said he <fullstop> theres a detective on our
 trail <fullstop>
 mcmurdo stared at him in astonishment <fullstop> why <comma> man <comma> youre crazy <comma> he
 said <fullstop> isnt the place full of police and detectives and what harm
 did they ever do us <question>
 no <comma> no <comma> its no man of the district <fullstop> as you say <comma> we know them <comma> and
 it is little that they can do <fullstop> but youve heard of pinkertons <question>
 ive read of some folk of that name <fullstop>
 well <comma> you can take it from me youve no show when they are on your
 trail <fullstop> its not a take-it-or-miss-it government concern <fullstop> its a dead
 earnest business proposition thats out for results and keeps out
 till by hook or crook it gets them <fullstop> if a pinkerton man is deep in
 this business <comma> we are all destroyed <fullstop>
 we must kill him <fullstop>
 ah <comma> its the first thought that came to you so it will be up at the
 lodge <fullstop> didnt i say to you that it would end in murder <question>
 it is <comma> indeed but its not for me to point out the man that is to
 be murdered <fullstop> id never rest easy again <fullstop> and yet its our own necks
 that may be at stake <fullstop> in gods name what shall i do <question> he rocked to
 and fro in his agony of indecision <fullstop>
 but his words had moved mcmurdo deeply <fullstop> it was easy to see that he
 shared the others opinion as to the danger <comma> and the need for meeting
 it <fullstop> he gripped morriss shoulder and shook him in his earnestness <fullstop>
 see here <comma> man <comma> he cried <comma> and he almost screeched the words in his
 excitement <comma> you wont gain anything by sitting keening like an old
 wife at a wake <fullstop> lets have the facts <fullstop> who is the fellow <question> where is he <question>
 how did you hear of him <question> why did you come to me <question>
 i came to you for you are the one man that would advise me <fullstop> i told
 you that i had a store in the east before i came here <fullstop> i left good
 friends behind me <comma> and one of them is in the telegraph service <fullstop>
 the top of the page <fullstop> you can read it yourself <fullstop>
 this was what mcmurdo read
 in the papers <fullstop> between you and me i expect to hear news from you
 before long <fullstop> five big corporations and the two railroads have taken
 the thing up in dead earnest <fullstop> they mean it <comma> and you can bet theyll
 get there they are right deep down into it <fullstop> pinkerton has taken hold
 under their orders <comma> and his best man <comma> birdy edwards <comma> is operating <fullstop>
 the thing has got to be stopped right now <fullstop>
 now read the postscript <fullstop>
 of course <comma> what i give you is what i learned in business so it goes
 no further <fullstop> its a queer cipher that you handle by the yard every day
 and can get no meaning from <fullstop>
 mcmurdo sat in silence for some time <comma> with the letter in his listless
 hands <fullstop> the mist had lifted for a moment <comma> and there was the abyss
 before him <fullstop>
 does anyone else know of this <question> he asked <fullstop>
 i have told no one else <fullstop>
 but this man--your friend--has he any other person that he would be
 likely to write to <question>
 well <comma> i dare say he knows one or two more <fullstop>
 of the lodge <question>
 its likely enough <fullstop>
 i was asking because it is likely that he may have given some
 description of this fellow birdy edwards--then we could get on his
 trail <fullstop>
 well <comma> its possible <fullstop> but i should not think he knew him <fullstop> he is just
 telling me the news that came to him by way of business <fullstop> how would he
 know this pinkerton man <question>
 mcmurdo gave a violent start <fullstop>
 by gar he cried <comma> ive got him <fullstop> what a fool i was not to know it <fullstop>
 lord but were in luck we will fix him before he can do any harm <fullstop>
 see here <comma> morris <comma> will you leave this thing in my hands <question>
 sure <comma> if you will only take it off mine <fullstop>
 ill do that <fullstop> you can stand right back and let me run it <fullstop> even your
 name need not be mentioned <fullstop> ill take it all on myself <comma> as if it were
 to me that this letter has come <fullstop> will that content you <question>
 its just what i would ask <fullstop>
 then leave it at that and keep your head shut <fullstop> now ill get down to
 the lodge <comma> and well soon make old man pinkerton sorry for himself <fullstop>
 you wouldnt kill this man <question>
 the less you know <comma> friend morris <comma> the easier your conscience will
 be <comma> and the better you will sleep <fullstop> ask no questions <comma> and let these
 things settle themselves <fullstop> i have hold of it now <fullstop>
 morris shook his head sadly as he left <fullstop> i feel that his blood is on
 my hands <comma> he groaned <fullstop>
 self-protection is no murder <comma> anyhow <comma> said mcmurdo <comma> smiling grimly <fullstop>
 its him or us <fullstop> i guess this man would destroy us all if we left him
 long in the valley <fullstop> why <comma> brother morris <comma> well have to elect you
 bodymaster yet for youve surely saved the lodge <fullstop>
 and yet it was clear from his actions that he thought more seriously
 of this new intrusion than his words would show <fullstop> it may have been his
 guilty conscience <comma> it may have been the reputation of the pinkerton
 organization <comma> it may have been the knowledge that great <comma> rich
 corporations had set themselves the task of clearing out the
 scowrers but <comma> whatever his reason <comma> his actions were those of a man
 who is preparing for the worst <fullstop> every paper which would incriminate
 him was destroyed before he left the house <fullstop> after that he gave a long
 sigh of satisfaction for it seemed to him that he was safe <fullstop> and yet
 the danger must still have pressed somewhat upon him for on his way
 to the lodge he stopped at old man shafters <fullstop> the house was forbidden
 him but when he tapped at the window ettie came out to him <fullstop> the
 dancing irish deviltry had gone from her lovers eyes <fullstop> she read his
 danger in his earnest face <fullstop>
 something has happened she cried <fullstop> oh <comma> jack <comma> you are in danger
 sure <comma> it is not very bad <comma> my sweetheart <fullstop> and yet it may be wise that
 we make a move before it is worse <fullstop>
 make a move <question>
 i promised you once that i would go some day <fullstop> i think the time is
 coming <fullstop> i had news to-night <comma> bad news <comma> and i see trouble coming <fullstop>
 the police <question>
 well <comma> a pinkerton <fullstop> but <comma> sure <comma> you wouldnt know what that is <comma>
 acushla <comma> nor what it may mean to the likes of me <fullstop> im too deep in
 this thing <comma> and i may have to get out of it quick <fullstop> you said you would
 come with me if i went <fullstop>
 oh <comma> jack <comma> it would be the saving of you
 im an honest man in some things <comma> ettie <fullstop> i wouldnt hurt a hair of
 your bonny head for all that the world can give <comma> nor ever pull you
 down one inch from the golden throne above the clouds where i always
 see you <fullstop> would you trust me <question>
 she put her hand in his without a word <fullstop> well <comma> then <comma> listen to what i
 say <comma> and do as i order you <comma> for indeed its the only way for us <fullstop>
 things are going to happen in this valley <fullstop> i feel it in my bones <fullstop>
 there may be many of us that will have to look out for ourselves <fullstop> im
 one <comma> anyhow <fullstop> if i go <comma> by day or night <comma> its you that must come with
 me
 id come after you <comma> jack <fullstop>
 no <comma> no <comma> you shall come with me <fullstop> if this valley is closed to me and i
 can never come back <comma> how can i leave you behind <comma> and me perhaps in
 hiding from the police with never a chance of a message <question> its with me
 you must come <fullstop> i know a good woman in the place i come from <comma> and its
 there id leave you till we can get married <fullstop> will you come <question>
 yes <comma> jack <comma> i will come <fullstop>
 god bless you for your trust in me its a fiend out of hell that i
 should be if i abused it <fullstop> now <comma> mark you <comma> ettie <comma> it will be just a
 word to you <comma> and when it reaches you <comma> you will drop everything and
 come right down to the waiting room at the depot and stay there till
 i come for you <fullstop>
 day or night <comma> ill come at the word <comma> jack <fullstop>
 somewhat eased in mind <comma> now that his own preparations for escape had
 been begun <comma> mcmurdo went on to the lodge <fullstop> it had already assembled <comma>
 and only by complicated signs and counter-signs could he pass through
 the outer guard and inner guard who close-tiled it <fullstop> a buzz of
 pleasure and welcome greeted him as he entered <fullstop> the long room was
 crowded <comma> and through the haze of tobacco smoke he saw the tangled
 black mane of the bodymaster <comma> the cruel <comma> unfriendly features of
 baldwin <comma> the vulture face of harraway <comma> the secretary <comma> and a dozen
 more who were among the leaders of the lodge <fullstop> he rejoiced that they
 should all be there to take counsel over his news <fullstop>
 indeed <comma> its glad we are to see you <comma> brother cried the chairman <fullstop>
 theres business here that wants a solomon in judgment to set it
 right <fullstop>
 its lander and egan <comma> explained his neighbour as he took his seat <fullstop>
 they both claim the head money given by the lodge for the shooting
 of old man crabbe over at stylestown <comma> and whos to say which fired
 the bullet <question>
 mcmurdo rose in his place and raised his hand <fullstop> the expression of his
 face froze the attention of the audience <fullstop> there was a dead hush of
 expectation <fullstop>
 eminent bodymaster <comma> he said <comma> in a solemn voice <comma> i claim urgency
 brother mcmurdo claims urgency <comma> said mcginty <fullstop> its a claim that by
 the rules of this lodge takes precedence <fullstop> now brother <comma> we attend
 you <fullstop>
 mcmurdo took the letter from his pocket <fullstop>
 eminent bodymaster and brethren <comma> he said <comma> i am the bearer of ill
 news this day but it is better that it should be known and
 discussed <comma> than that a blow should fall upon us without warning which
 would destroy us all <fullstop> i have information that the most powerful and
 richest organizations in this state have bound themselves together
 for our destruction <comma> and that at this very moment there is a
 pinkerton detective <comma> one birdy edwards <comma> at work in the valley
 collecting the evidence which may put a rope round the necks of many
 of us <comma> and send every man in this room into a felons cell <fullstop> that is
 the situation for the discussion of which i have made a claim of
 urgency <fullstop>
 there was a dead silence in the room <fullstop> it was broken by the chairman <fullstop>
 what is your evidence for this <comma> brother mcmurdo <question> he asked <fullstop>
 it is in this letter which has come into my hands <comma> said mcmurdo <fullstop> he
 read the passage aloud <fullstop> it is a matter of honour with me that i can
 hands but i assure you that there is nothing else in it which can
 affect the interests of the lodge <fullstop> i put the case before you as it
 has reached me <fullstop>
 let me say <comma> mr <fullstop> chairman <comma> said one of the older brethren <comma> that i
 have heard of birdy edwards <comma> and that he has the name of being the
 best man in the pinkerton service <fullstop>
 does anyone know him by sight <question> asked mcginty <fullstop>
 yes <comma> said mcmurdo <comma> i do <fullstop>
 there was a murmur of astonishment through the hall <fullstop>
 i believe we hold him in the hollow of our hands <comma> he continued with
 an exulting smile upon his face <fullstop> if we act quickly and wisely <comma> we
 can cut this thing short <fullstop> if i have your confidence and your help <comma> it
 is little that we have to fear <fullstop>
 what have we to fear <comma> anyhow <question> what can he know of our affairs <question>
 you might say so if all were as stanch as you <comma> councillor <fullstop> but this
 man has all the millions of the capitalists at his back <fullstop> do you think
 there is no weaker brother among all our lodges that could not be
 bought <question> he will get at our secrets--maybe has got them already <fullstop>
 theres only one sure cure <fullstop>
 that he never leaves the valley <comma> said baldwin <fullstop>
 mcmurdo nodded <fullstop> good for you <comma> brother baldwin <comma> he said <fullstop> you and i
 have had our differences <comma> but you have said the true word to-night <fullstop>
 where is he <comma> then <question> where shall we know him <question>
 eminent bodymaster <comma> said mcmurdo <comma> earnestly <comma> i would put it to you
 that this is too vital a thing for us to discuss in open lodge <fullstop> god
 forbid that i should throw a doubt on anyone here but if so much as
 a word of gossip got to the ears of this man <comma> there would be an end
 of any chance of our getting him <fullstop> i would ask the lodge to choose a
 trusty committee <comma> mr <fullstop> chairman--yourself <comma> if i might suggest it <comma> and
 brother baldwin here <comma> and five more <fullstop> then i can talk freely of what i
 know and of what i advise should be done <fullstop>
 the proposition was at once adopted <comma> and the committee chosen <fullstop>
 besides the chairman and baldwin there were the vulture-faced
 secretary <comma> harraway <comma> tiger cormac <comma> the brutal young assassin <comma> carter <comma>
 the treasurer <comma> and the brothers willaby <comma> fearless and desperate men
 who would stick at nothing <fullstop>
 the usual revelry of the lodge was short and subdued for there was a
 cloud upon the mens spirits <comma> and many there for the first time began
 to see the cloud of avenging law drifting up in that serene sky under
 which they had dwelt so long <fullstop> the horrors they had dealt out to
 thought of retribution had become a remote one <comma> and so seemed the
 more startling now that it came so closely upon them <fullstop> they broke up
 early and left their leaders to their council <fullstop>
 now <comma> mcmurdo said mcginty when they were alone <fullstop> the seven men sat
 frozen in their seats <fullstop>
 i said just now that i knew birdy edwards <comma> mcmurdo explained <fullstop> i
 need not tell you that he is not here under that name <fullstop> hes a brave
 man <comma> but not a crazy one <fullstop> he passes under the name of steve wilson <comma>
 and he is lodging at hobsons patch <fullstop>
 how do you know this <question>
 because i fell into talk with him <fullstop> i thought little of it at the
 time <comma> nor would have given it a second thought but for this letter
 but now im sure its the man <fullstop> i met him on the cars when i went down
 the line on wednesday--a hard case if ever there was one <fullstop> he said he
 was a reporter <fullstop> i believed it for the moment <fullstop> wanted to know all he
 could about the scowrers and what he called the outrages for a new
 york paper <fullstop> asked me every kind of question so as to get something <fullstop>
 you bet i was giving nothing away <fullstop> id pay for it and pay well <comma>
 said he <comma> if i could get some stuff that would suit my editor <fullstop> i
 said what i thought would please him best <comma> and he handed me a
 twenty-dollar bill for my information <fullstop> theres ten times that for
 you <comma> said he <comma> if you can find me all that i want <fullstop>
 what did you tell him <comma> then <question>
 any stuff i could make up <fullstop>
 how do you know he wasnt a newspaper man <question>
 ill tell you <fullstop> he got out at hobsons patch <comma> and so did i <fullstop> i chanced
 into the telegraph bureau <comma> and he was leaving it <fullstop>
 see here <comma> said the operator after hed gone out <comma> i guess we
 should charge double rates for this <fullstop>--i guess you should <comma> said i <fullstop>
 he had filled the form with stuff that might have been chinese <comma> for
 all we could make of it <fullstop> he fires a sheet of this off every day <comma>
 said the clerk <fullstop> yes <comma> said i its special news for his paper <comma> and
 hes scared that the others should tap it <fullstop> that was what the
 operator thought and what i thought at the time but i think
 differently now <fullstop>
 by gar i believe you are right <comma> said mcginty <fullstop> but what do you
 allow that we should do about it <question>
 why not go right down now and fix him <question> someone suggested <fullstop>
 ay <comma> the sooner the better <fullstop>
 id start this next minute if i knew where we could find him <comma> said
 mcmurdo <fullstop> hes in hobsons patch but i dont know the house <fullstop> ive
 got a plan <comma> though <comma> if youll only take my advice <fullstop>
 well <comma> what is it <question>
 ill go to the patch to-morrow morning <fullstop> ill find him through the
 operator <fullstop> he can locate him <comma> i guess <fullstop> well <comma> then ill tell him that
 im a freeman myself <fullstop> ill offer him all the secrets of the lodge for
 a price <fullstop> you bet hell tumble to it <fullstop> ill tell him the papers are at
 my house <comma> and that its as much as my life would be worth to let him
 come while folk were about <fullstop> hell see that thats horse sense <fullstop> let
 him come at ten oclock at night <comma> and he shall see everything <fullstop> that
 will fetch him sure <fullstop>
 well <question>
 you can plan the rest for yourselves <fullstop> widow macnamaras is a lonely
 house <fullstop> shes as true as steel and as deaf as a post <fullstop> theres only
 scanlan and me in the house <fullstop> if i get his promise--and ill let you
 know if i do--id have the whole seven of you come to me by nine
 oclock <fullstop> well get him in <fullstop> if ever he gets out alive--well <comma> he can
 talk of birdy edwardss luck for the rest of his days
 theres going to be a vacancy at pinkertons or im mistaken <fullstop> leave
 it at that <comma> mcmurdo <fullstop> at nine to-morrow well be with you <fullstop> you once
 get the door shut behind him <comma> and you can leave the rest with us <fullstop>
 the trapping of birdy edwards
 as mcmurdo had said <comma> the house in which he lived was a lonely one and
 very well suited for such a crime as they had planned <fullstop> it was on the
 extreme fringe of the town and stood well back from the road <fullstop> in any
 other case the conspirators would have simply called out their man <comma>
 as they had many a time before <comma> and emptied their pistols into his
 body but in this instance it was very necessary to find out how much
 he knew <comma> how he knew it <comma> and what had been passed on to his
 employers <fullstop>
 it was possible that they were already too late and that the work had
 been done <fullstop> if that was indeed so <comma> they could at least have their
 revenge upon the man who had done it <fullstop> but they were hopeful that
 nothing of great importance had yet come to the detectives
 knowledge <comma> as otherwise <comma> they argued <comma> he would not have troubled to
 write down and forward such trivial information as mcmurdo claimed to
 have given him <fullstop> however <comma> all this they would learn from his own lips <fullstop>
 once in their power <comma> they would find a way to make him speak <fullstop> it was
 not the first time that they had handled an unwilling witness <fullstop>
 mcmurdo went to hobsons patch as agreed <fullstop> the police seemed to take
 had claimed the old acquaintance with him at chicago--actually
 addressed him as he waited at the station <fullstop> mcmurdo turned away and
 refused to speak with him <fullstop> he was back from his mission in the
 afternoon <comma> and saw mcginty at the union house <fullstop>
 he is coming <comma> he said <fullstop>
 good said mcginty <fullstop> the giant was in his shirt sleeves <comma> with chains
 and seals gleaming athwart his ample waistcoat and a diamond
 twinkling through the fringe of his bristling beard <fullstop> drink and
 politics had made the boss a very rich as well as powerful man <fullstop> the
 more terrible <comma> therefore <comma> seemed that glimpse of the prison or the
 gallows which had risen before him the night before <fullstop>
 do you reckon he knows much <question> he asked anxiously <fullstop>
 mcmurdo shook his head gloomily <fullstop> hes been here some time--six weeks
 prospect <fullstop> if he has been working among us all that time with the
 railroad money at his back <comma> i should expect that he has got results <comma>
 and that he has passed them on <fullstop>
 theres not a weak man in the lodge <comma> cried mcginty <fullstop> true as steel <comma>
 every man of them <fullstop> and yet <comma> by the lord there is that skunk morris <fullstop>
 what about him <question> if any man gives us away <comma> it would be he <fullstop> ive a mind
 to send a couple of the boys round before evening to give him a
 beating up and see what they can get from him <fullstop>
 well <comma> there would be no harm in that <comma> mcmurdo answered <fullstop> i wont
 deny that i have a liking for morris and would be sorry to see him
 come to harm <fullstop> he has spoken to me once or twice over lodge matters <comma>
 and though he may not see them the same as you or i <comma> he never seemed
 the sort that squeals <fullstop> but still it is not for me to stand between
 him and you <fullstop>
 ill fix the old devil said mcginty with an oath <fullstop> ive had my eye
 on him this year past <fullstop>
 well <comma> you know best about that <comma> mcmurdo answered <fullstop> but whatever you
 do must be to-morrow for we must lie low until the pinkerton affair
 is settled up <fullstop> we cant afford to set the police buzzing <comma> to-day of
 all days <fullstop>
 true for you <comma> said mcginty <fullstop> and well learn from birdy edwards
 himself where he got his news if we have to cut his heart out first <fullstop>
 did he seem to scent a trap <question>
 mcmurdo laughed <fullstop> i guess i took him on his weak point <comma> he said <fullstop> if
 he could get on a good trail of the scowrers <comma> hes ready to follow it
 into hell <fullstop> i took his money <comma> mcmurdo grinned as he produced a wad of
 dollar notes <comma> and as much more when he has seen all my papers <fullstop>
 what papers <question>
 well <comma> there are no papers <fullstop> but i filled him up about constitutions
 and books of rules and forms of membership <fullstop> he expects to get right
 down to the end of everything before he leaves <fullstop>
 faith <comma> hes right there <comma> said mcginty grimly <fullstop> didnt he ask you
 why you didnt bring him the papers <question>
 as if i would carry such things <comma> and me a suspected man <comma> and captain
 marvin after speaking to me this very day at the depot
 ay <comma> i heard of that <comma> said mcginty <fullstop> i guess the heavy end of this
 business is coming on to you <fullstop> we could put him down an old shaft when
 weve done with him but however we work it we cant get past the man
 living at hobsons patch and you being there to-day <fullstop>
 mcmurdo shrugged his shoulders <fullstop> if we handle it right <comma> they can
 never prove the killing <comma> said he <fullstop> no one can see him come to the
 house after dark <comma> and ill lay to it that no one will see him go <fullstop> now
 see here <comma> councillor <comma> ill show you my plan and ill ask you to fit
 the others into it <fullstop> you will all come in good time <fullstop> very well <fullstop> he
 comes at ten <fullstop> he is to tap three times <comma> and me to open the door for
 him <fullstop> then ill get behind him and shut it <fullstop> hes our man then <fullstop>
 thats all easy and plain <fullstop>
 yes but the next step wants considering <fullstop> hes a hard proposition <fullstop>
 hes heavily armed <fullstop> ive fooled him proper <comma> and yet he is likely to
 be on his guard <fullstop> suppose i show him right into a room with seven men
 in it where he expected to find me alone <fullstop> there is going to be
 shooting <comma> and somebody is going to be hurt <fullstop>
 thats so <fullstop>
 and the noise is going to bring every damned copper in the township
 on top of it <fullstop>
 i guess you are right <fullstop>
 this is how i should work it <fullstop> you will all be in the big room--same
 as you saw when you had a chat with me <fullstop> ill open the door for him <comma>
 show him into the parlour beside the door <comma> and leave him there while
 i get the papers <fullstop> that will give me the chance of telling you how
 things are shaping <fullstop> then i will go back to him with some faked
 papers <fullstop> as he is reading them i will jump for him and get my grip on
 his pistol arm <fullstop> youll hear me call and in you will rush <fullstop> the quicker
 the better for he is as strong a man as i <comma> and i may have more than
 i can manage <fullstop> but i allow that i can hold him till you come <fullstop>
 its a good plan <comma> said mcginty <fullstop> the lodge will owe you a debt for
 this <fullstop> i guess when i move out of the chair i can put a name to the
 man thats coming after me <fullstop>
 sure <comma> councillor <comma> i am little more than a recruit <comma> said mcmurdo
 but his face showed what he thought of the great mans compliment <fullstop>
 when he had returned home he made his own preparations for the grim
 evening in front of him <fullstop> first he cleaned <comma> oiled <comma> and loaded his
 smith wesson revolver <fullstop> then he surveyed the room in which the
 deal table in the centre <comma> and the big stove at one side <fullstop> at each of
 the other sides were windows <fullstop> there were no shutters on these only
 light curtains which drew across <fullstop> mcmurdo examined these attentively <fullstop>
 for so secret a meeting <fullstop> yet its distance from the road made it of
 less consequence <fullstop> finally he discussed the matter with his fellow
 lodger <fullstop> scanlan <comma> though a scowrer <comma> was an inoffensive little man who
 was too weak to stand against the opinion of his comrades <comma> but was
 secretly horrified by the deeds of blood at which he had sometimes
 been forced to assist <fullstop> mcmurdo told him shortly what was intended <fullstop>
 and if i were you <comma> mike scanlan <comma> i would take a night off and keep
 clear of it <fullstop> there will be bloody work here before morning <fullstop>
 well <comma> indeed then <comma> mac <comma> scanlan answered <fullstop> its not the will but
 the nerve that is wanting in me <fullstop> when i saw manager dunn go down at
 the colliery yonder it was just more than i could stand <fullstop> im not made
 for it <comma> same as you or mcginty <fullstop> if the lodge will think none the
 worse of me <comma> ill just do as you advise and leave you to yourselves
 for the evening <fullstop>
 the men came in good time as arranged <fullstop> they were outwardly
 respectable citizens <comma> well clad and cleanly but a judge of faces
 would have read little hope for birdy edwards in those hard mouths
 and remorseless eyes <fullstop> there was not a man in the room whose hands had
 not been reddened a dozen times before <fullstop> they were as hardened to
 human murder as a butcher to sheep <fullstop>
 foremost <comma> of course <comma> both in appearance and in guilt <comma> was the
 formidable boss <fullstop> harraway <comma> the secretary <comma> was a lean <comma> bitter man with
 a long <comma> scraggy neck and nervous <comma> jerky limbs <comma> a man of incorruptible
 fidelity where the finances of the order were concerned <comma> and with no
 notion of justice or honesty to anyone beyond <fullstop> the treasurer <comma> carter <comma>
 was a middle-aged man <comma> with an impassive <comma> rather sulky expression <comma>
 and a yellow parchment skin <fullstop> he was a capable organizer <comma> and the
 actual details of nearly every outrage had sprung from his plotting
 brain <fullstop> the two willabys were men of action <comma> tall <comma> lithe young fellows
 with determined faces <comma> while their companion <comma> tiger cormac <comma> a heavy <comma>
 dark youth <comma> was feared even by his own comrades for the ferocity of
 his disposition <fullstop> these were the men who assembled that night under
 the roof of mcmurdo for the killing of the pinkerton detective <fullstop>
 their host had placed whisky upon the table <comma> and they had hastened to
 prime themselves for the work before them <fullstop> baldwin and cormac were
 already half-drunk <comma> and the liquor had brought out all their
 ferocity <fullstop> cormac placed his hands on the stove for an instant--it had
 been lighted <comma> for the nights were still cold <fullstop>
 that will do <comma> said he <comma> with an oath <fullstop>
 ay <comma> said baldwin <comma> catching his meaning <fullstop> if he is strapped to that <comma>
 we will have the truth out of him <fullstop>
 well have the truth out of him <comma> never fear <comma> said mcmurdo <fullstop> he had
 nerves of steel <comma> this man for though the whole weight of the affair
 was on him his manner was as cool and unconcerned as ever <fullstop> the others
 marked it and applauded <fullstop>
 you are the one to handle him <comma> said the boss approvingly <fullstop> not a
 warning will he get till your hand is on his throat <fullstop> its a pity
 there are no shutters to your windows <fullstop>
 mcmurdo went from one to the other and drew the curtains tighter <fullstop>
 sure no one can spy upon us now <fullstop> its close upon the hour <fullstop>
 maybe he wont come <fullstop> maybe hell get a sniff of danger <comma> said the
 secretary <fullstop>
 hell come <comma> never fear <comma> mcmurdo answered <fullstop> he is as eager to come
 as you can be to see him <fullstop> hark to that
 they all sat like wax figures <comma> some with their glasses arrested
 halfway to their lips <fullstop> three loud knocks had sounded at the door <fullstop>
 hush mcmurdo raised his hand in caution <fullstop> an exulting glance went
 round the circle <comma> and hands were laid upon hidden weapons <fullstop>
 not a sound <comma> for your lives mcmurdo whispered <comma> as he went from the
 room <comma> closing the door carefully behind him <fullstop>
 with strained ears the murderers waited <fullstop> they counted the steps of
 their comrade down the passage <fullstop> then they heard him open the outer
 door <fullstop> there were a few words as of greeting <fullstop> then they were aware of
 a strange step inside and of an unfamiliar voice <fullstop> an instant later
 came the slam of the door and the turning of the key in the lock <fullstop>
 their prey was safe within the trap <fullstop> tiger cormac laughed horribly <comma>
 and boss mcginty clapped his great hand across his mouth <fullstop>
 be quiet <comma> you fool he whispered <fullstop> youll be the undoing of us
 yet
 there was a mutter of conversation from the next room <fullstop> it seemed
 interminable <fullstop> then the door opened <comma> and mcmurdo appeared <comma> his finger
 upon his lip <fullstop>
 he came to the end of the table and looked round at them <fullstop> a subtle
 change had come over him <fullstop> his manner was as of one who has great work
 to do <fullstop> his face had set into granite firmness <fullstop> his eyes shone with a
 fierce excitement behind his spectacles <fullstop> he had become a visible
 leader of men <fullstop> they stared at him with eager interest but he said
 nothing <fullstop> still with the same singular gaze he looked from man to man <fullstop>
 well cried boss mcginty at last <fullstop> is he here <question> is birdy edwards
 here <question>
 yes <comma> mcmurdo answered slowly <fullstop> birdy edwards is here <fullstop> i am birdy
 edwards
 there were ten seconds after that brief speech during which the room
 might have been empty <comma> so profound was the silence <fullstop> the hissing of a
 kettle upon the stove rose sharp and strident to the ear <fullstop> seven white
 faces <comma> all turned upward to this man who dominated them <comma> were set
 motionless with utter terror <fullstop> then <comma> with a sudden shivering of glass <comma>
 a bristle of glistening rifle barrels broke through each window <comma>
 while the curtains were torn from their hangings <fullstop>
 at the sight boss mcginty gave the roar of a wounded bear and plunged
 for the half-opened door <fullstop> a levelled revolver met him there with the
 stern blue eyes of captain marvin of the mine police gleaming behind
 the sights <fullstop> the boss recoiled and fell back into his chair <fullstop>
 youre safer there <comma> councillor <comma> said the man whom they had known as
 mcmurdo <fullstop> and you <comma> baldwin <comma> if you dont take your hand off your
 pistol <comma> youll cheat the hangman yet <fullstop> pull it out <comma> or by the lord
 that made me--there <comma> that will do <fullstop> there are forty armed men round
 this house <comma> and you can figure it out for yourself what chance you
 have <fullstop> take their pistols <comma> marvin
 there was no possible resistance under the menace of those rifles <fullstop>
 the men were disarmed <fullstop> sulky <comma> sheepish <comma> and amazed <comma> they still sat
 round the table <fullstop>
 id like to say a word to you before we separate <comma> said the man who
 had trapped them <fullstop> i guess we may not meet again until you see me on
 the stand in the courthouse <fullstop> ill give you something to think over
 between now and then <fullstop> you know me now for what i am <fullstop> at last i can
 put my cards on the table <fullstop> i am birdy edwards of pinkertons <fullstop> i was
 chosen to break up your gang <fullstop> i had a hard and dangerous game to
 play <fullstop> not a soul <comma> not one soul <comma> not my nearest and dearest <comma> knew that
 i was playing it <fullstop> only captain marvin here and my employers knew
 that <fullstop> but its over to-night <comma> thank god <comma> and i am the winner
 the seven pale <comma> rigid faces looked up at him <fullstop> there was unappeasable
 hatred in their eyes <fullstop> he read the relentless threat <fullstop>
 maybe you think that the game is not over yet <fullstop> well <comma> i take my
 chance of that <fullstop> anyhow <comma> some of you will take no further hand <comma> and
 there are sixty more besides yourselves that will see a jail this
 night <fullstop> ill tell you this <comma> that when i was put upon this job i never
 believed there was such a society as yours <fullstop> i thought it was paper
 talk <comma> and that i would prove it so <fullstop> they told me it was to do with
 the freemen so i went to chicago and was made one <fullstop> then i was surer
 than ever that it was just paper talk for i found no harm in the
 society <comma> but a deal of good <fullstop>
 still <comma> i had to carry out my job <comma> and i came to the coal valleys <fullstop>
 when i reached this place i learned that i was wrong and that it
 wasnt a dime novel after all <fullstop> so i stayed to look after it <fullstop> i never
 killed a man in chicago <fullstop> i never minted a dollar in my life <fullstop> those i
 gave you were as good as any others but i never spent money better <fullstop>
 but i knew the way into your good wishes and so i pretended to you
 that the law was after me <fullstop> it all worked just as i thought <fullstop>
 so i joined your infernal lodge <comma> and i took my share in your
 councils <fullstop> maybe they will say that i was as bad as you <fullstop> they can say
 what they like <comma> so long as i get you <fullstop> but what is the truth <question> the
 night i joined you beat up old man stanger <fullstop> i could not warn him <comma> for
 there was no time but i held your hand <comma> baldwin <comma> when you would have
 killed him <fullstop> if ever i have suggested things <comma> so as to keep my place
 among you <comma> they were things which i knew i could prevent <fullstop> i could not
 save dunn and menzies <comma> for i did not know enough but i will see that
 their murderers are hanged <fullstop> i gave chester wilcox warning <comma> so that
 when i blew his house in he and his folk were in hiding <fullstop> there was
 many a crime that i could not stop but if you look back and think
 how often your man came home the other road <comma> or was down in town when
 you went for him <comma> or stayed indoors when you thought he would come
 out <comma> youll see my work <fullstop>
 you blasted traitor hissed mcginty through his closed teeth <fullstop>
 ay <comma> john mcginty <comma> you may call me that if it eases your smart <fullstop> you
 took a man to get between you and the poor devils of men and women
 that you held under your grip <fullstop> there was just one way of doing it <comma>
 and i did it <fullstop> you call me a traitor but i guess theres many a
 thousand will call me a deliverer that went down into hell to save
 them <fullstop> ive had three months of it <fullstop> i wouldnt have three such months
 again if they let me loose in the treasury at washington for it <fullstop> i
 had to stay till i had it all <comma> every man and every secret right here
 in this hand <fullstop> id have waited a little longer if it hadnt come to my
 knowledge that my secret was coming out <fullstop> a letter had come into the
 town that would have set you wise to it all <fullstop> then i had to act and
 act quickly <fullstop>
 ive nothing more to say to you <comma> except that when my time comes ill
 die the easier when i think of the work i have done in this valley <fullstop>
 now <comma> marvin <comma> ill keep you no more <fullstop> take them in and get it over <fullstop>
 there is little more to tell <fullstop> scanlan had been given a sealed note to
 be left at the address of miss ettie shafter <comma> a mission which he had
 accepted with a wink and a knowing smile <fullstop> in the early hours of the
 morning a beautiful woman and a much muffled man boarded a special
 train which had been sent by the railroad company <comma> and made a swift <comma>
 unbroken journey out of the land of danger <fullstop> it was the last time that
 ever either ettie or her lover set foot in the valley of fear <fullstop> ten
 days later they were married in chicago <comma> with old jacob shafter as
 witness of the wedding <fullstop>
 the trial of the scowrers was held far from the place where their
 adherents might have terrified the guardians of the law <fullstop> in vain they
 struggled <fullstop> in vain the money of the lodge--money squeezed by
 blackmail out of the whole countryside--was spent like water in the
 attempt to save them <fullstop> that cold <comma> clear <comma> unimpassioned statement from
 one who knew every detail of their lives <comma> their organization <comma> and
 their crimes was unshaken by all the wiles of their defenders <fullstop> at
 last after so many years they were broken and scattered <fullstop> the cloud
 was lifted forever from the valley <fullstop>
 mcginty met his fate upon the scaffold <comma> cringing and whining when the
 last hour came <fullstop> eight of his chief followers shared his fate <fullstop>
 fifty-odd had various degrees of imprisonment <fullstop> the work of birdy
 edwards was complete <fullstop>
 and yet <comma> as he had guessed <comma> the game was not over yet <fullstop> there was
 another hand to be played <comma> and yet another and another <fullstop> ted baldwin <comma>
 for one <comma> had escaped the scaffold so had the willabys so had
 several others of the fiercest spirits of the gang <fullstop> for ten years
 they were out of the world <comma> and then came a day when they were free
 once more--a day which edwards <comma> who knew his men <comma> was very sure would
 be an end of his life of peace <fullstop> they had sworn an oath on all that
 they thought holy to have his blood as a vengeance for their
 comrades <fullstop> and well they strove to keep their vow
 from chicago he was chased <comma> after two attempts so near success that
 it was sure that the third would get him <fullstop> from chicago he went under
 a changed name to california <comma> and it was there that the light went
 for a time out of his life when ettie edwards died <fullstop> once again he was
 nearly killed <comma> and once again under the name of douglas he worked in
 amassed a fortune <fullstop> at last there came a warning to him that the
 bloodhounds were on his track once more <comma> and he cleared--only just in
 time--for england <fullstop> and thence came the john douglas who for a second
 time married a worthy mate <comma> and lived for five years as a sussex
 county gentleman <comma> a life which ended with the strange happenings of
 which we have heard <fullstop>
 epilogue
 the police trial had passed <comma> in which the case of john douglas was
 referred to a higher court <fullstop> so had the quarter sessions <comma> at which he
 was acquitted as having acted in self-defense <fullstop>
 get him out of england at any cost <comma> wrote holmes to the wife <fullstop>
 there are forces here which may be more dangerous than those he has
 escaped <fullstop> there is no safety for your husband in england <fullstop>
 two months had gone by <comma> and the case had to some extent passed from
 our minds <fullstop> then one morning there came an enigmatic note slipped into
 our letter box <fullstop> dear me <comma> mr <fullstop> holmes <fullstop> dear me said this singular
 epistle <fullstop> there was neither superscription nor signature <fullstop> i laughed at
 the quaint message but holmes showed unwonted seriousness <fullstop>
 deviltry <comma> watson he remarked <comma> and sat long with a clouded brow <fullstop>
 late last night mrs <fullstop> hudson <comma> our landlady <comma> brought up a message that
 a gentleman wished to see holmes <comma> and that the matter was of the
 utmost importance <fullstop> close at the heels of his messenger came cecil
 barker <comma> our friend of the moated manor house <fullstop> his face was drawn and
 haggard <fullstop>
 ive had bad news--terrible news <comma> mr <fullstop> holmes <comma> said he <fullstop>
 i feared as much <comma> said holmes <fullstop>
 you have not had a cable <comma> have you <question>
 i have had a note from someone who has <fullstop>
 its poor douglas <fullstop> they tell me his name is edwards but he will
 always be jack douglas of benito canyon to me <fullstop> i told you that they
 started together for south africa in the palmyra three weeks ago <fullstop>
 exactly <fullstop>
 the ship reached cape town last night <fullstop> i received this cable from
 mrs <fullstop> douglas this morning--
 jack has been lost overboard in gale off st <fullstop> helena <fullstop> no one knows
 how accident occurred <fullstop>
 ivy douglas <fullstop>
 ha it came like that <comma> did it <question> said holmes <comma> thoughtfully <fullstop> well <comma>
 ive no doubt it was well stage-managed <fullstop>
 you mean that you think there was no accident <question>
 none in the world <fullstop>
 he was murdered <question>
 surely
 so i think also <fullstop> these infernal scowrers <comma> this cursed vindictive
 nest of criminals--
 no <comma> no <comma> my good sir <comma> said holmes <fullstop> there is a master hand here <fullstop> it
 is no case of sawed-off shot-guns and clumsy six-shooters <fullstop> you can
 tell an old master by the sweep of his brush <fullstop> i can tell a moriarty
 when i see one <fullstop> this crime is from london <comma> not from america <fullstop>
 but for what motive <question>
 because it is done by a man who cannot afford to fail--one whose
 whole unique position depends upon the fact that all he does must
 succeed <fullstop> a great brain and a huge organization have been turned to
 the extinction of one man <fullstop> it is crushing the nut with the hammer--an
 absurd extravagance of energy--but the nut is very effectually
 crushed all the same <fullstop>
 how came this man to have anything to do with it <question>
 i can only say that the first word that ever came to us of the
 business was from one of his lieutenants <fullstop> these americans were well
 any foreign criminal could do <comma> this great consultant in crime <fullstop> from
 that moment their man was doomed <fullstop> at first he would content himself
 by using his machinery in order to find their victim <fullstop> then he would
 indicate how the matter might be treated <fullstop> finally <comma> when he read in
 the reports of the failure of this agent <comma> he would step in himself
 with a master touch <fullstop> you heard me warn this man at birlstone manor
 house that the coming danger was greater than the past <fullstop> was i right <question>
 barker beat his head with his clenched fist in his impotent anger <fullstop>
 do you tell me that we have to sit down under this <question> do you say that
 no one can ever get level with this king-devil <question>
 no <comma> i dont say that <comma> said holmes <comma> and his eyes seemed to be
 looking far into the future <fullstop> i dont say that he cant be beat <fullstop> but
 you must give me time--you must give me time
 we all sat in silence for some minutes <comma> while those fateful eyes
 still strained to pierce the veil <fullstop>
 the adventure of the three students
 it was in the year 95 that a combination of events <comma> into which i
 weeks in one of our great university towns <comma> and it was during this
 time that the small but instructive adventure which i am about to
 relate befell us <fullstop> it will be obvious that any details which would
 help the reader to exactly identify the college or the criminal would
 be injudicious and offensive <fullstop> so painful a scandal may well be
 allowed to die out <fullstop> with due discretion the incident itself may <comma>
 however <comma> be described <comma> since it serves to illustrate some of those
 qualities for which my friend was remarkable <fullstop> i will endeavour in my
 statement to avoid such terms as would serve to limit the events to
 we were residing at the time in furnished lodgings close to a library
 english charters--researches which led to results so striking that
 they may be the subject of one of my future narratives <fullstop> here it was
 that one evening we received a visit from an acquaintance <comma> mr <fullstop> hilton
 soames <comma> tutor and lecturer at the college of st <fullstop> lukes <fullstop> mr <fullstop> soames
 was a tall <comma> spare man <comma> of a nervous and excitable temperament <fullstop> i had
 occasion he was in such a state of uncontrollable agitation that it
 was clear something very unusual had occurred <fullstop>
 i trust <comma> mr <fullstop> holmes <comma> that you can spare me a few hours of your
 valuable time <fullstop> we have had a very painful incident at st <fullstop> lukes <comma> and
 really <comma> but for the happy chance of your being in the town <comma> i should
 have been at a loss what to do <fullstop>
 i am very busy just now <comma> and i desire no distractions <comma> my friend
 answered <fullstop> i should much prefer that you called in the aid of the
 police <fullstop>
 no <comma> no <comma> my dear sir such a course is utterly impossible <fullstop> when once
 the law is evoked it cannot be stayed again <comma> and this is just one of
 those cases where <comma> for the credit of the college <comma> it is most
 essential to avoid scandal <fullstop> your discretion is as well known as your
 powers <comma> and you are the one man in the world who can help me <fullstop> i beg
 you <comma> mr <fullstop> holmes <comma> to do what you can <fullstop>
 my friends temper had not improved since he had been deprived of the
 congenial surroundings of baker street <fullstop> without his scrap-books <comma> his
 chemicals <comma> and his homely untidiness <comma> he was an uncomfortable man <fullstop> he
 shrugged his shoulders in ungracious acquiescence <comma> while our visitor
 in hurried words and with much excitable gesticulation poured forth
 his story <fullstop>
 i must explain to you <comma> mr <fullstop> holmes <comma> that to-morrow is the first day
 of the examination for the fortescue scholarship <fullstop> i am one of the
 examiners <fullstop> my subject is greek <comma> and the first of the papers consists
 of a large passage of greek translation which the candidate has not
 seen <fullstop> this passage is printed on the examination paper <comma> and it would
 naturally be an immense advantage if the candidate could prepare it
 in advance <fullstop> for this reason great care is taken to keep the paper
 secret <fullstop>
 to-day about three oclock the proofs of this paper arrived from the
 had to read it over carefully <comma> as the text must be absolutely
 correct <fullstop> at four-thirty my task was not yet completed <fullstop> i had <comma>
 however <comma> promised to take tea in a friends rooms <comma> so i left the
 proof upon my desk <fullstop> i was absent rather more than an hour <fullstop>
 you are aware <comma> mr <fullstop> holmes <comma> that our college doors are double--a
 green baize one within and a heavy oak one without <fullstop> as i approached
 my outer door i was amazed to see a key in it <fullstop> for an instant i
 imagined that i had left my own there <comma> but on feeling in my pocket i
 found that it was all right <fullstop> the only duplicate which existed <comma> so far
 as i knew <comma> was that which belonged to my servant <comma> bannister <comma> a man
 who has looked after my room for ten years <comma> and whose honesty is
 absolutely above suspicion <fullstop> i found that the key was indeed his <comma> that
 he had entered my room to know if i wanted tea <comma> and that he had very
 carelessly left the key in the door when he came out <fullstop> his visit to my
 room must have been within a very few minutes of my leaving it <fullstop> his
 forgetfulness about the key would have mattered little upon any other
 occasion <comma> but on this one day it has produced the most deplorable
 consequences <fullstop>
 the moment i looked at my table i was aware that someone had
 rummaged among my papers <fullstop> the proof was in three long slips <fullstop> i had
 left them all together <fullstop> now <comma> i found that one of them was lying on
 the floor <comma> one was on the side table near the window <comma> and the third
 was where i had left it <fullstop>
 holmes stirred for the first time <fullstop>
 the first page on the floor <comma> the second in the window <comma> the third
 where you left it <comma> said he <fullstop>
 exactly <comma> mr <fullstop> holmes <fullstop> you amaze me <fullstop> how could you possibly know
 that <question>
 pray continue your very interesting statement <fullstop>
 for an instant i imagined that bannister had taken the unpardonable
 liberty of examining my papers <fullstop> he denied it <comma> however <comma> with the
 utmost earnestness <comma> and i am convinced that he was speaking the
 truth <fullstop> the alternative was that someone passing had observed the key
 in the door <comma> had known that i was out <comma> and had entered to look at the
 papers <fullstop> a large sum of money is at stake <comma> for the scholarship is a
 very valuable one <comma> and an unscrupulous man might very well run a risk
 in order to gain an advantage over his fellows <fullstop>
 bannister was very much upset by the incident <fullstop> he had nearly fainted
 when we found that the papers had undoubtedly been tampered with <fullstop> i
 gave him a little brandy and left him collapsed in a chair while i
 made a most careful examination of the room <fullstop> i soon saw that the
 intruder had left other traces of his presence besides the rumpled
 papers <fullstop> on the table in the window were several shreds from a pencil
 which had been sharpened <fullstop> a broken tip of lead was lying there also <fullstop>
 evidently the rascal had copied the paper in a great hurry <comma> had
 broken his pencil <comma> and had been compelled to put a fresh point to
 it <fullstop>
 excellent said holmes <comma> who was recovering his good-humour as his
 attention became more engrossed by the case <fullstop> fortune has been your
 friend <fullstop>
 this was not all <fullstop> i have a new writing-table with a fine surface of
 red leather <fullstop> i am prepared to swear <comma> and so is bannister <comma> that it was
 smooth and unstained <fullstop> now i found a clean cut in it about three
 inches long--not a mere scratch <comma> but a positive cut <fullstop> not only this <comma>
 but on the table i found a small ball of black dough <comma> or clay <comma> with
 specks of something which looks like sawdust in it <fullstop> i am convinced
 that these marks were left by the man who rifled the papers <fullstop> there
 were no footmarks and no other evidence as to his identity <fullstop> i was at
 my wits ends <comma> when suddenly the happy thought occurred to me that
 you were in the town <comma> and i came straight round to put the matter
 into your hands <fullstop> do help me <comma> mr <fullstop> holmes you see my dilemma <fullstop> either i
 must find the man or else the examination must be postponed until
 fresh papers are prepared <comma> and since this cannot be done without
 explanation there will ensue a hideous scandal <comma> which will throw a
 cloud not only on the college <comma> but on the university <fullstop> above all
 things i desire to settle the matter quietly and discreetly <fullstop>
 i shall be happy to look into it and to give you such advice as i
 can <comma> said holmes <comma> rising and putting on his overcoat <fullstop> the case is
 not entirely devoid of interest <fullstop> had anyone visited you in your room
 after the papers came to you <question>
 yes young daulat ras <comma> an indian student who lives on the same
 for which he was entered <question>
 yes <fullstop>
 and the papers were on your table <question>
 to the best of my belief they were rolled up <fullstop>
 but might be recognised as proofs <question>
 possibly <fullstop>
 no one else in your room <question>
 no <fullstop>
 did anyone know that these proofs would be there <question>
 no one save the printer <fullstop>
 did this man bannister know <question>
 no <comma> certainly not <fullstop> no one knew <fullstop>
 where is bannister now <question>
 he was very ill <comma> poor fellow <fullstop> i left him collapsed in the chair <fullstop> i
 was in such a hurry to come to you <fullstop>
 you left your door open <question>
 i locked up the papers first <fullstop>
 then it amounts to this <comma> mr <fullstop> soames <comma> that unless the indian student
 recognised the roll as being proofs <comma> the man who tampered with them
 came upon them accidentally without knowing that they were there <fullstop>
 so it seems to me <fullstop>
 holmes gave an enigmatic smile <fullstop>
 well <comma> said he <comma> let us go round <fullstop> not one of your cases <comma>
 watson--mental <comma> not physical <fullstop> all right come if you want to <fullstop> now <comma>
 mr <fullstop> soames--at your disposal
 the sitting-room of our client opened by a long <comma> low <comma> latticed
 window on to the ancient lichen-tinted court of the old college <fullstop> a
 gothic arched door led to a worn stone staircase <fullstop> on the ground floor
 was the tutors room <fullstop> above were three students <comma> one on each story <fullstop>
 it was already twilight when we reached the scene of our problem <fullstop>
 holmes halted and looked earnestly at the window <fullstop> then he approached
 it <comma> and <comma> standing on tiptoe with his neck craned <comma> he looked into the
 room <fullstop>
 he must have entered through the door <fullstop> there is no opening except
 the one pane <comma> said our learned guide <fullstop>
 dear me said holmes <comma> and he smiled in a singular way as he glanced
 at our companion <fullstop> well <comma> if there is nothing to be learned here we
 had best go inside <fullstop>
 the lecturer unlocked the outer door and ushered us into his room <fullstop> we
 stood at the entrance while holmes made an examination of the carpet <fullstop>
 i am afraid there are no signs here <comma> said he <fullstop> one could hardly
 hope for any upon so dry a day <fullstop> your servant seems to have quite
 recovered <fullstop> you left him in a chair <comma> you say which chair <question>
 by the window there <fullstop>
 i see <fullstop> near this little table <fullstop> you can come in now <fullstop> i have finished
 with the carpet <fullstop> let us take the little table first <fullstop> of course <comma> what
 has happened is very clear <fullstop> the man entered and took the papers <comma>
 sheet by sheet <comma> from the central table <fullstop> he carried them over to the
 window table <comma> because from there he could see if you came across the
 courtyard <comma> and so could effect an escape <fullstop>
 as a matter of fact he could not <comma> said soames <comma> for i entered by
 the side door <fullstop>
 ah <comma> thats good well <comma> anyhow <comma> that was in his mind <fullstop> let me see the
 three strips <fullstop> no finger impressions--no well <comma> he carried over this
 one first and he copied it <fullstop> how long would it take him to do that <comma>
 using every possible contraction <question> a quarter of an hour <comma> not less <fullstop>
 then he tossed it down and seized the next <fullstop> he was in the midst of
 that when your return caused him to make a very hurried retreat--very
 hurried <comma> since he had not time to replace the papers which would tell
 you that he had been there <fullstop> you were not aware of any hurrying feet
 on the stair as you entered the outer door <question>
 no <comma> i cant say i was <fullstop>
 well <comma> he wrote so furiously that he broke his pencil <comma> and had <comma> as
 you observe <comma> to sharpen it again <fullstop> this is of interest <comma> watson <fullstop> the
 pencil was not an ordinary one <fullstop> it was above the usual size <comma> with a
 soft lead the outer colour was dark blue <comma> the makers name was
 printed in silver lettering <comma> and the piece remaining is only about an
 inch and a half long <fullstop> look for such a pencil <comma> mr <fullstop> soames <comma> and you
 have got your man <fullstop> when i add that he possesses a large and very
 blunt knife <comma> you have an additional aid <fullstop>
 mr <fullstop> soames was somewhat overwhelmed by this flood of information <fullstop> i
 can follow the other points <comma> said he <comma> but really <comma> in this matter of
 the length--
 holmes held out a small chip with the letters nn and a space of clear
 wood after them <fullstop>
 you see <question>
 no <comma> i fear that even now--
 watson <comma> i have always done you an injustice <fullstop> there are others <fullstop> what
 could this nn be <question> it is at the end of a word <fullstop> you are aware that
 johann faber is the most common makers name <fullstop> is it not clear that
 there is just as much of the pencil left as usually follows the
 johann <question> he held the small table sideways to the electric light <fullstop> i
 was hoping that if the paper on which he wrote was thin some trace of
 it might come through upon this polished surface <fullstop> no <comma> i see nothing <fullstop>
 i dont think there is anything more to be learned here <fullstop> now for the
 central table <fullstop> this small pellet is <comma> i presume <comma> the black <comma> doughy
 mass you spoke of <fullstop> roughly pyramidal in shape and hollowed out <comma> i
 perceive <fullstop> as you say <comma> there appear to be grains of sawdust in it <fullstop>
 dear me <comma> this is very interesting <fullstop> and the cut--a positive tear <comma> i
 see <fullstop> it began with a thin scratch and ended in a jagged hole <fullstop> i am
 much indebted to you for directing my attention to this case <comma> mr <fullstop>
 soames <fullstop> where does that door lead to <question>
 to my bedroom <fullstop>
 have you been in it since your adventure <question>
 no i came straight away for you <fullstop>
 i should like to have a glance round <fullstop> what a charming <comma> old-fashioned
 room perhaps you will kindly wait a minute until i have examined the
 floor <fullstop> no <comma> i see nothing <fullstop> what about this curtain <question> you hang your
 clothes behind it <fullstop> if anyone were forced to conceal himself in this
 room he must do it there <comma> since the bed is too low and the wardrobe
 too shallow <fullstop> no one there <comma> i suppose <question>
 as holmes drew the curtain i was aware <comma> from some little rigidity and
 alertness of his attitude <comma> that he was prepared for an emergency <fullstop> as
 a matter of fact the drawn curtain disclosed nothing but three or
 four suits of clothes hanging from a line of pegs <fullstop> holmes turned away
 and stooped suddenly to the floor <fullstop>
 halloa whats this <question> said he <fullstop>
 it was a small pyramid of black <comma> putty-like stuff <comma> exactly like the
 one upon the table of the study <fullstop> holmes held it out on his open palm
 in the glare of the electric light <fullstop>
 your visitor seems to have left traces in your bedroom as well as in
 your sitting-room <comma> mr <fullstop> soames <fullstop>
 what could he have wanted there <question>
 i think it is clear enough <fullstop> you came back by an unexpected way <comma> and
 so he had no warning until you were at the very door <fullstop> what could he
 do <question> he caught up everything which would betray him and he rushed into
 your bedroom to conceal himself <fullstop>
 good gracious <comma> mr <fullstop> holmes <comma> do you mean to tell me that all the time
 i was talking to bannister in this room we had the man prisoner if we
 had only known it <question>
 so i read it <fullstop>
 surely there is another alternative <comma> mr <fullstop> holmes <fullstop> i dont know
 whether you observed my bedroom window <question>
 lattice-paned <comma> lead framework <comma> three separate windows <comma> one swinging
 on hinge and large enough to admit a man <fullstop>
 exactly <fullstop> and it looks out on an angle of the courtyard so as to be
 left traces as he passed through the bedroom <comma> and <comma> finally <comma> finding
 the door open have escaped that way <fullstop>
 holmes shook his head impatiently <fullstop>
 let us be practical <comma> said he <fullstop> i understand you to say that there
 are three students who use this stair and are in the habit of passing
 your door <question>
 yes <comma> there are <fullstop>
 and they are all in for this examination <question>
 yes <fullstop>
 have you any reason to suspect any one of them more than the
 others <question>
 soames hesitated <fullstop>
 it is a very delicate question <comma> said he <fullstop> one hardly likes to throw
 suspicion where there are no proofs <fullstop>
 let us hear the suspicions <fullstop> i will look after the proofs <fullstop>
 i will tell you <comma> then <comma> in a few words the character of the three men
 who inhabit these rooms <fullstop> the lower of the three is gilchrist <comma> a fine
 scholar and athlete plays in the rugby team and the cricket team for
 the college <comma> and got his blue for the hurdles and the long jump <fullstop> he
 is a fine <comma> manly fellow <fullstop> his father was the notorious sir jabez
 gilchrist <comma> who ruined himself on the turf <fullstop> my scholar has been left
 very poor <comma> but he is hard-working and industrious <fullstop> he will do well <fullstop>
 the second floor is inhabited by daulat ras <comma> the indian <fullstop> he is a
 quiet <comma> inscrutable fellow <comma> as most of those indians are <fullstop> he is well
 up in his work <comma> though his greek is his weak subject <fullstop> he is steady
 and methodical <fullstop>
 the top floor belongs to miles mclaren <fullstop> he is a brilliant fellow
 when he chooses to work--one of the brightest intellects of the
 university <comma> but he is wayward <comma> dissipated <comma> and unprincipled <fullstop> he was
 nearly expelled over a card scandal in his first year <fullstop> he has been
 idling all this term <comma> and he must look forward with dread to the
 examination <fullstop>
 then it is he whom you suspect <question>
 i dare not go so far as that <fullstop> but of the three he is perhaps the
 least unlikely <fullstop>
 exactly <fullstop> now <comma> mr <fullstop> soames <comma> let us have a look at your servant <comma>
 bannister <fullstop>
 he was a little <comma> white-faced <comma> clean-shaven <comma> grizzly-haired fellow of
 fifty <fullstop> he was still suffering from this sudden disturbance of the
 quiet routine of his life <fullstop> his plump face was twitching with his
 nervousness <comma> and his fingers could not keep still <fullstop>
 we are investigating this unhappy business <comma> bannister <comma> said his
 master <fullstop>
 yes <comma> sir <fullstop>
 i understand <comma> said holmes <comma> that you left your key in the door <question>
 yes <comma> sir <fullstop>
 was it not very extraordinary that you should do this on the very
 day when there were these papers inside <question>
 it was most unfortunate <comma> sir <fullstop> but i have occasionally done the same
 thing at other times <fullstop>
 when did you enter the room <question>
 it was about half-past four <fullstop> that is mr <fullstop> soamess tea time <fullstop>
 how long did you stay <question>
 when i saw that he was absent i withdrew at once <fullstop>
 did you look at these papers on the table <question>
 no <comma> sir certainly not <fullstop>
 how came you to leave the key in the door <question>
 i had the tea-tray in my hand <fullstop> i thought i would come back for the
 key <fullstop> then i forgot <fullstop>
 has the outer door a spring lock <question>
 no <comma> sir <fullstop>
 then it was open all the time <question>
 yes <comma> sir <fullstop>
 anyone in the room could get out <question>
 yes <comma> sir <fullstop>
 when mr <fullstop> soames returned and called for you <comma> you were very much
 disturbed <question>
 yes <comma> sir <fullstop> such a thing has never happened during the many years that
 i have been here <fullstop> i nearly fainted <comma> sir <fullstop>
 so i understand <fullstop> where were you when you began to feel bad <question>
 where was i <comma> sir <question> why <comma> here <comma> near the door <fullstop>
 that is singular <comma> because you sat down in that chair over yonder
 near the corner <fullstop> why did you pass these other chairs <question>
 i dont know <comma> sir <fullstop> it didnt matter to me where i sat <fullstop>
 i really dont think he knew much about it <comma> mr <fullstop> holmes <fullstop> he was
 looking very bad--quite ghastly <fullstop>
 you stayed here when your master left <question>
 only for a minute or so <fullstop> then i locked the door and went to my
 room <fullstop>
 whom do you suspect <question>
 oh <comma> i would not venture to say <comma> sir <fullstop> i dont believe there is any
 gentleman in this university who is capable of profiting by such an
 action <fullstop> no <comma> sir <comma> ill not believe it <fullstop>
 thank you that will do <comma> said holmes <fullstop> oh <comma> one more word <fullstop> you have
 not mentioned to any of the three gentlemen whom you attend that
 anything is amiss <question>
 no <comma> sir not a word <fullstop>
 you havent seen any of them <question>
 no <comma> sir <fullstop>
 very good <fullstop> now <comma> mr <fullstop> soames <comma> we will take a walk in the quadrangle <comma>
 if you please <fullstop>
 three yellow squares of light shone above us in the gathering gloom <fullstop>
 your three birds are all in their nests <comma> said holmes <comma> looking up <fullstop>
 halloa whats that <question> one of them seems restless enough <fullstop>
 it was the indian <comma> whose dark silhouette appeared suddenly upon his
 blind <fullstop> he was pacing swiftly up and down his room <fullstop>
 i should like to have a peep at each of them <comma> said holmes <fullstop> is it
 possible <question>
 no difficulty in the world <comma> soames answered <fullstop> this set of rooms is
 quite the oldest in the college <comma> and it is not unusual for visitors
 to go over them <fullstop> come along <comma> and i will personally conduct you <fullstop>
 no names <comma> please said holmes <comma> as we knocked at gilchrists door <fullstop> a
 tall <comma> flaxen-haired <comma> slim young fellow opened it <comma> and made us welcome
 when he understood our errand <fullstop> there were some really curious pieces
 of mediaeval domestic architecture within <fullstop> holmes was so charmed with
 one of them that he insisted on drawing it on his note-book <comma> broke
 his pencil <comma> had to borrow one from our host <comma> and finally borrowed a
 knife to sharpen his own <fullstop> the same curious accident happened to him
 in the rooms of the indian--a silent <comma> little <comma> hook-nosed fellow <comma> who
 eyed us askance and was obviously glad when holmess architectural
 studies had come to an end <fullstop> i could not see that in either case
 holmes had come upon the clue for which he was searching <fullstop> only at the
 third did our visit prove abortive <fullstop> the outer door would not open to
 our knock <comma> and nothing more substantial than a torrent of bad
 language came from behind it <fullstop> i dont care who you are <fullstop> you can go
 to blazes roared the angry voice <fullstop> to-morrows the exam <comma> and i
 wont be drawn by anyone <fullstop>
 a rude fellow <comma> said our guide <comma> flushing with anger as we withdrew
 down the stair <fullstop> of course <comma> he did not realize that it was i who was
 knocking <comma> but none the less his conduct was very uncourteous <comma> and <comma>
 indeed <comma> under the circumstances rather suspicious <fullstop>
 holmess response was a curious one <fullstop>
 can you tell me his exact height <question> he asked <fullstop>
 really <comma> mr <fullstop> holmes <comma> i cannot undertake to say <fullstop> he is taller than the
 indian <comma> not so tall as gilchrist <fullstop> i suppose five foot six would be
 about it <fullstop>
 that is very important <comma> said holmes <fullstop> and now <comma> mr <fullstop> soames <comma> i wish
 you good-night <fullstop>
 our guide cried aloud in his astonishment and dismay <fullstop> good gracious <comma>
 mr <fullstop> holmes <comma> you are surely not going to leave me in this abrupt
 fashion you dont seem to realize the position <fullstop> to-morrow is the
 examination <fullstop> i must take some definite action to-night <fullstop> i cannot
 allow the examination to be held if one of the papers has been
 tampered with <fullstop> the situation must be faced <fullstop>
 you must leave it as it is <fullstop> i shall drop round early to-morrow
 morning and chat the matter over <fullstop> it is possible that i may be in a
 position then to indicate some course of action <fullstop> meanwhile you change
 nothing--nothing at all <fullstop>
 very good <comma> mr <fullstop> holmes <fullstop>
 you can be perfectly easy in your mind <fullstop> we shall certainly find some
 way out of your difficulties <fullstop> i will take the black clay with me <comma>
 also the pencil cuttings <fullstop> good-bye <fullstop>
 when we were out in the darkness of the quadrangle we again looked up
 at the windows <fullstop> the indian still paced his room <fullstop> the others were
 invisible <fullstop>
 well <comma> watson <comma> what do you think of it <question> holmes asked <comma> as we came out
 into the main street <fullstop> quite a little parlour game--sort of
 three-card trick <comma> is it not <question> there are your three men <fullstop> it must be one
 of them <fullstop> you take your choice <fullstop> which is yours <question>
 the foul-mouthed fellow at the top <fullstop> he is the one with the worst
 record <fullstop> and yet that indian was a sly fellow also <fullstop> why should he be
 pacing his room all the time <question>
 there is nothing in that <fullstop> many men do it when they are trying to
 learn anything by heart <fullstop>
 he looked at us in a queer way <fullstop>
 so would you if a flock of strangers came in on you when you were
 preparing for an examination next day <comma> and every moment was of value <fullstop>
 no <comma> i see nothing in that <fullstop> pencils <comma> too <comma> and knives--all was
 satisfactory <fullstop> but that fellow does puzzle me <fullstop>
 who <question>
 why <comma> bannister <comma> the servant <fullstop> whats his game in the matter <question>
 he impressed me as being a perfectly honest man <fullstop>
 honest man--well <comma> well <comma> heres a large stationers <fullstop> we shall begin
 our researches here <fullstop>
 there were only four stationers of any consequence in the town <comma> and
 at each holmes produced his pencil chips and bid high for a
 duplicate <fullstop> all were agreed that one could be ordered <comma> but that it was
 not a usual size of pencil and that it was seldom kept in stock <fullstop> my
 friend did not appear to be depressed by his failure <comma> but shrugged
 his shoulders in half-humorous resignation <fullstop>
 no good <comma> my dear watson <fullstop> this <comma> the best and only final clue <comma> has run
 to nothing <fullstop> but <comma> indeed <comma> i have little doubt that we can build up a
 sufficient case without it <fullstop> by jove my dear fellow <comma> it is nearly
 nine <comma> and the landlady babbled of green peas at seven-thirty <fullstop> what
 with your eternal tobacco <comma> watson <comma> and your irregularity at meals <comma> i
 expect that you will get notice to quit and that i shall share your
 downfall--not <comma> however <comma> before we have solved the problem of the
 nervous tutor <comma> the careless servant <comma> and the three enterprising
 students <fullstop>
 holmes made no further allusion to the matter that day <comma> though he
 sat lost in thought for a long time after our belated dinner <fullstop> at
 eight in the morning he came into my room just as i finished my
 toilet <fullstop>
 well <comma> watson <comma> said he <comma> it is time we went down to st <fullstop> lukes <fullstop> can
 you do without breakfast <question>
 certainly <fullstop>
 soames will be in a dreadful fidget until we are able to tell him
 something positive <fullstop>
 have you anything positive to tell him <question>
 i think so <fullstop>
 you have formed a conclusion <question>
 yes <comma> my dear watson i have solved the mystery <fullstop>
 but what fresh evidence could you have got <question>
 aha it is not for nothing that i have turned myself out of bed at
 the untimely hour of six <fullstop> i have put in two hours hard work and
 covered at least five miles <comma> with something to show for it <fullstop> look at
 that
 he held out his hand <fullstop> on the palm were three little pyramids of
 black <comma> doughy clay <fullstop>
 why <comma> holmes <comma> you had only two yesterday
 and one more this morning <fullstop> it is a fair argument that wherever no <fullstop> 3
 came from is also the source of nos <fullstop> 1 and 2 <fullstop> eh <comma> watson <question> well <comma> come
 along and put friend soames out of his pain <fullstop>
 the unfortunate tutor was certainly in a state of pitiable agitation
 when we found him in his chambers <fullstop> in a few hours the examination
 would commence <comma> and he was still in the dilemma between making the
 facts public and allowing the culprit to compete for the valuable
 scholarship <fullstop> he could hardly stand still <comma> so great was his mental
 agitation <comma> and he ran towards holmes with two eager hands
 outstretched <fullstop>
 thank heaven that you have come i feared that you had given it up
 in despair <fullstop> what am i to do <question> shall the examination proceed <question>
 yes let it proceed by all means <fullstop>
 but this rascal-- <question>
 he shall not compete <fullstop>
 you know him <question>
 i think so <fullstop> if this matter is not to become public we must give
 ourselves certain powers <comma> and resolve ourselves into a small private
 court-martial <fullstop> you there <comma> if you please <comma> soames watson <comma> you here
 ill take the arm-chair in the middle <fullstop> i think that we are now
 sufficiently imposing to strike terror into a guilty breast <fullstop> kindly
 ring the bell
 bannister entered <comma> and shrunk back in evident surprise and fear at
 our judicial appearance <fullstop>
 you will kindly close the door <comma> said holmes <fullstop> now <comma> bannister <comma> will
 you please tell us the truth about yesterdays incident <question>
 the man turned white to the roots of his hair <fullstop>
 i have told you everything <comma> sir <fullstop>
 nothing to add <question>
 nothing at all <comma> sir <fullstop>
 well <comma> then <comma> i must make some suggestions to you <fullstop> when you sat down
 on that chair yesterday <comma> did you do so in order to conceal some
 object which would have shown who had been in the room <question>
 bannisters face was ghastly <fullstop>
 no <comma> sir certainly not <fullstop>
 it is only a suggestion <comma> said holmes <comma> suavely <fullstop> i frankly admit
 that i am unable to prove it <fullstop> but it seems probable enough <comma> since the
 moment that mr <fullstop> soamess back was turned you released the man who was
 hiding in that bedroom <fullstop>
 bannister licked his dry lips <fullstop>
 there was no man <comma> sir <fullstop>
 ah <comma> thats a pity <comma> bannister <fullstop> up to now you may have spoken the
 truth <comma> but now i know that you have lied <fullstop>
 the mans face set in sullen defiance <fullstop>
 there was no man <comma> sir <fullstop>
 come <comma> come <comma> bannister
 no <comma> sir there was no one <fullstop>
 in that case you can give us no further information <fullstop> would you
 please remain in the room <question> stand over there near the bedroom door <fullstop>
 now <comma> soames <comma> i am going to ask you to have the great kindness to go
 up to the room of young gilchrist <comma> and to ask him to step down into
 yours <fullstop>
 an instant later the tutor returned <comma> bringing with him the student <fullstop>
 he was a fine figure of a man <comma> tall <comma> lithe <comma> and agile <comma> with a springy
 step and a pleasant <comma> open face <fullstop> his troubled blue eyes glanced at
 each of us <comma> and finally rested with an expression of blank dismay
 upon bannister in the farther corner <fullstop>
 just close the door <comma> said holmes <fullstop> now <comma> mr <fullstop> gilchrist <comma> we are all
 quite alone here <comma> and no one need ever know one word of what passes
 between us <fullstop> we can be perfectly frank with each other <fullstop> we want to
 know <comma> mr <fullstop> gilchrist <comma> how you <comma> an honourable man <comma> ever came to commit
 such an action as that of yesterday <question>
 the unfortunate young man staggered back and cast a look full of
 horror and reproach at bannister <fullstop>
 no <comma> no <comma> mr <fullstop> gilchrist <comma> sir i never said a word--never one word
 cried the servant <fullstop>
 no <comma> but you have now <comma> said holmes <fullstop> now <comma> sir <comma> you must see that
 after bannisters words your position is hopeless <comma> and that your only
 chance lies in a frank confession <fullstop>
 for a moment gilchrist <comma> with upraised hand <comma> tried to control his
 writhing features <fullstop> the next he had thrown himself on his knees beside
 the table and <comma> burying his face in his hands <comma> he had burst into a
 storm of passionate sobbing <fullstop>
 come <comma> come <comma> said holmes <comma> kindly it is human to err <comma> and at least
 no one can accuse you of being a callous criminal <fullstop> perhaps it would
 be easier for you if i were to tell mr <fullstop> soames what occurred <comma> and you
 can check me where i am wrong <fullstop> shall i do so <question> well <comma> well <comma> dont
 trouble to answer <fullstop> listen <comma> and see that i do you no injustice <fullstop>
 from the moment <comma> mr <fullstop> soames <comma> that you said to me that no one <comma> not
 even bannister <comma> could have told that the papers were in your room <comma>
 the case began to take a definite shape in my mind <fullstop> the printer one
 could <comma> of course <comma> dismiss <fullstop> he could examine the papers in his own
 office <fullstop> the indian i also thought nothing of <fullstop> if the proofs were in a
 roll he could not possibly know what they were <fullstop> on the other hand <comma> it
 seemed an unthinkable coincidence that a man should dare to enter the
 room <comma> and that by chance on that very day the papers were on the
 table <fullstop> i dismissed that <fullstop> the man who entered knew that the papers
 were there <fullstop> how did he know <question>
 when i approached your room i examined the window <fullstop> you amused me by
 supposing that i was contemplating the possibility of someone having
 in broad daylight <comma> under the eyes of all these opposite rooms <comma> forced
 himself through it <fullstop> such an idea was absurd <fullstop> i was measuring how tall
 a man would need to be in order to see as he passed what papers were
 on the central table <fullstop> i am six feet high <comma> and i could do it with an
 effort <fullstop> no one less than that would have a chance <fullstop> already you see i
 had reason to think that if one of your three students was a man of
 unusual height he was the most worth watching of the three <fullstop>
 i entered and i took you into my confidence as to the suggestions of
 the side table <fullstop> of the centre table i could make nothing <comma> until in
 your description of gilchrist you mentioned that he was a
 long-distance jumper <fullstop> then the whole thing came to me in an instant <comma>
 and i only needed certain corroborative proofs <comma> which i speedily
 obtained <fullstop>
 what happened was this <fullstop> this young fellow had employed his afternoon
 at the athletic grounds <comma> where he had been practising the jump <fullstop> he
 returned carrying his jumping shoes <comma> which are provided <comma> as you are
 aware <comma> with several sharp spikes <fullstop> as he passed your window he saw <comma> by
 means of his great height <comma> these proofs upon your table <comma> and
 conjectured what they were <fullstop> no harm would have been done had it not
 been that as he passed your door he perceived the key which had been
 left by the carelessness of your servant <fullstop> a sudden impulse came over
 him to enter and see if they were indeed the proofs <fullstop> it was not a
 dangerous exploit <comma> for he could always pretend that he had simply
 looked in to ask a question <fullstop>
 well <comma> when he saw that they were indeed the proofs <comma> it was then that
 he yielded to temptation <fullstop> he put his shoes on the table <fullstop> what was it
 you put on that chair near the window <question>
 gloves <comma> said the young man <fullstop>
 holmes looked triumphantly at bannister <fullstop> he put his gloves on the
 chair <comma> and he took the proofs <comma> sheet by sheet <comma> to copy them <fullstop> he
 thought the tutor must return by the main gate <comma> and that he would see
 him <fullstop> as we know <comma> he came back by the side gate <fullstop> suddenly he heard him
 at the very door <fullstop> there was no possible escape <fullstop> he forgot his gloves <comma>
 but he caught up his shoes and darted into the bedroom <fullstop> you observe
 that the scratch on that table is slight at one side <comma> but deepens in
 the direction of the bedroom door <fullstop> that in itself is enough to show
 us that the shoe had been drawn in that direction and that the
 culprit had taken refuge there <fullstop> the earth round the spike had been
 left on the table <comma> and a second sample was loosened and fell in the
 bedroom <fullstop> i may add that i walked out to the athletic grounds this
 morning <comma> saw that tenacious black clay is used in the jumping-pit <comma>
 and carried away a specimen of it <comma> together with some of the fine tan
 or sawdust which is strewn over it to prevent the athlete from
 slipping <fullstop> have i told the truth <comma> mr <fullstop> gilchrist <question>
 the student had drawn himself erect <fullstop>
 yes <comma> sir <comma> it is true <comma> said he <fullstop>
 good heavens <comma> have you nothing to add <question> cried soames <fullstop>
 yes <comma> sir <comma> i have <comma> but the shock of this disgraceful exposure has
 bewildered me <fullstop> i have a letter here <comma> mr <fullstop> soames <comma> which i wrote to you
 early this morning in the middle of a restless night <fullstop> it was before i
 knew that my sin had found me out <fullstop> here it is <comma> sir <fullstop> you will see that
 i have said <comma> i have determined not to go in for the examination <fullstop> i
 have been offered a commission in the rhodesian police <comma> and i am
 going out to south africa at once <fullstop>
 i am indeed pleased to hear that you did not intend to profit by
 your unfair advantage <comma> said soames <fullstop> but why did you change your
 purpose <question>
 gilchrist pointed to bannister <fullstop>
 there is the man who set me in the right path <comma> said he <fullstop>
 come now <comma> bannister <comma> said holmes <fullstop> it will be clear to you from
 what i have said that only you could have let this young man out <comma>
 since you were left in the room <comma> and must have locked the door when
 you went out <fullstop> as to his escaping by that window <comma> it was incredible <fullstop>
 can you not clear up the last point in this mystery <comma> and tell us the
 reasons for your action <question>
 it was simple enough <comma> sir <comma> if you only had known but with all your
 cleverness it was impossible that you could know <fullstop> time was <comma> sir <comma> when
 i was butler to old sir jabez gilchrist <comma> this young gentlemans
 father <fullstop> when he was ruined i came to the college as servant <comma> but i
 never forgot my old employer because he was down in the world <fullstop> i
 watched his son all i could for the sake of the old days <fullstop> well <comma> sir <comma>
 when i came into this room yesterday when the alarm was given <comma> the
 very first thing i saw was mr <fullstop> gilchrists tan gloves a-lying in that
 chair <fullstop> i knew those gloves well <comma> and i understood their message <fullstop> if
 mr <fullstop> soames saw them the game was up <fullstop> i flopped down into that chair <comma>
 and nothing would budge me until mr <fullstop> soames he went for you <fullstop> then out
 came my poor young master <comma> whom i had dandled on my knee <comma> and
 confessed it all to me <fullstop> wasnt it natural <comma> sir <comma> that i should save
 him <comma> and wasnt it natural also that i should try to speak to him as
 his dead father would have done <comma> and make him understand that he
 could not profit by such a deed <question> could you blame me <comma> sir <question>
 no <comma> indeed <comma> said holmes <comma> heartily <comma> springing to his feet <fullstop> well <comma>
 soames <comma> i think we have cleared your little problem up <comma> and our
 breakfast awaits us at home <fullstop> come <comma> watson as to you <comma> sir <comma> i trust
 that a bright future awaits you in rhodesia <fullstop> for once you have fallen
 low <fullstop> let us see in the future how high you can rise <fullstop>
 the adventure of wisteria lodge
 the singular experience of mr <fullstop> john scott eccles
 i find it recorded in my notebook that it was a bleak and windy day
 towards the end of march in the year 1892 <fullstop> holmes had received a
 telegram while we sat at our lunch <comma> and he had scribbled a reply <fullstop> he
 made no remark <comma> but the matter remained in his thoughts <comma> for he stood
 in front of the fire afterwards with a thoughtful face <comma> smoking his
 pipe <comma> and casting an occasional glance at the message <fullstop> suddenly he
 turned upon me with a mischievous twinkle in his eyes <fullstop>
 i suppose <comma> watson <comma> we must look upon you as a man of letters <comma> said
 he <fullstop> how do you define the word grotesque <question>
 strange--remarkable <comma> i suggested <fullstop>
 he shook his head at my definition <fullstop>
 there is surely something more than that <comma> said he some underlying
 suggestion of the tragic and the terrible <fullstop> if you cast your mind
 back to some of those narratives with which you have afflicted a
 long-suffering public <comma> you will recognize how often the grotesque has
 deepened into the criminal <fullstop> think of that little affair of the
 red-headed men <fullstop> that was grotesque enough in the outset <comma> and yet it
 ended in a desperate attempt at robbery <fullstop> or <comma> again <comma> there was that
 most grotesque affair of the five orange pips <comma> which let straight to
 a murderous conspiracy <fullstop> the word puts me on the alert <fullstop>
 have you it there <question> i asked <fullstop>
 he read the telegram aloud <fullstop>
 have just had most incredible and grotesque experience <fullstop> may i
 consult you <question>
 scott eccles <comma>
 post office <comma> charing cross <fullstop>
 man or woman <question> i asked <fullstop>
 oh <comma> man <comma> of course <fullstop> no woman would ever send a reply-paid telegram <fullstop>
 she would have come <fullstop>
 will you see him <question>
 my dear watson <comma> you know how bored i have been since we locked up
 colonel carruthers <fullstop> my mind is like a racing engine <comma> tearing itself
 to pieces because it is not connected up with the work for which it
 was built <fullstop> life is commonplace <comma> the papers are sterile audacity and
 romance seem to have passed forever from the criminal world <fullstop> can you
 ask me <comma> then <comma> whether i am ready to look into any new problem <comma>
 however trivial it may prove <question> but here <comma> unless i am mistaken <comma> is our
 client <fullstop>
 a measured step was heard upon the stairs <comma> and a moment later a
 stout <comma> tall <comma> gray-whiskered and solemnly respectable person was
 ushered into the room <fullstop> his life history was written in his heavy
 features and pompous manner <fullstop> from his spats to his gold-rimmed
 spectacles he was a conservative <comma> a churchman <comma> a good citizen <comma>
 orthodox and conventional to the last degree <fullstop> but some amazing
 experience had disturbed his native composure and left its traces in
 his bristling hair <comma> his flushed <comma> angry cheeks <comma> and his flurried <comma>
 excited manner <fullstop> he plunged instantly into his business <fullstop>
 i have had a most singular and unpleasant experience <comma> mr <fullstop> holmes <comma>
 said he <fullstop> never in my life have i been placed in such a situation <fullstop> it
 is most improper--most outrageous <fullstop> i must insist upon some
 explanation <fullstop> he swelled and puffed in his anger <fullstop>
 pray sit down <comma> mr <fullstop> scott eccles <comma> said holmes in a soothing voice <fullstop>
 may i ask <comma> in the first place <comma> why you came to me at all <question>
 well <comma> sir <comma> it did not appear to be a matter which concerned the
 police <comma> and yet <comma> when you have heard the facts <comma> you must admit that i
 could not leave it where it was <fullstop> private detectives are a class with
 whom i have absolutely no sympathy <comma> but none the less <comma> having heard
 your name--
 quite so <fullstop> but <comma> in the second place <comma> why did you not come at once <question>
 what do you mean <question>
 holmes glanced at his watch <fullstop>
 it is a quarter-past two <comma> he said <fullstop> your telegram was dispatched
 about one <fullstop> but no one can glance at your toilet and attire without
 seeing that your disturbance dates from the moment of your waking <fullstop>
 our client smoothed down his unbrushed hair and felt his unshaven
 chin <fullstop>
 you are right <comma> mr <fullstop> holmes <fullstop> i never gave a thought to my toilet <fullstop> i
 was only too glad to get out of such a house <fullstop> but i have been running
 round making inquiries before i came to you <fullstop> i went to the house
 agents <comma> you know <comma> and they said that mr <fullstop> garcias rent was paid up
 all right and that everything was in order at wisteria lodge <fullstop>
 come <comma> come <comma> sir <comma> said holmes <comma> laughing <fullstop> you are like my friend <comma>
 dr <fullstop> watson <comma> who has a bad habit of telling his stories wrong end
 foremost <fullstop> please arrange your thoughts and let me know <comma> in their due
 sequence <comma> exactly what those events are which have sent you out
 unbrushed and unkempt <comma> with dress boots and waistcoat buttoned awry <comma>
 in search of advice and assistance <fullstop>
 our client looked down with a rueful face at his own unconventional
 appearance <fullstop>
 im sure it must look very bad <comma> mr <fullstop> holmes <comma> and i am not aware that
 in my whole life such a thing has ever happened before <fullstop> but will tell
 you the whole queer business <comma> and when i have done so you will admit <comma>
 i am sure <comma> that there has been enough to excuse me <fullstop>
 but his narrative was nipped in the bud <fullstop> there was a bustle outside <comma>
 and mrs <fullstop> hudson opened the door to usher in two robust and
 official-looking individuals <comma> one of whom was well known to us as
 inspector gregson of scotland yard <comma> an energetic <comma> gallant <comma> and <comma>
 within his limitations <comma> a capable officer <fullstop> he shook hands with holmes
 and introduced his comrade as inspector baynes <comma> of the surrey
 constabulary <fullstop>
 we are hunting together <comma> mr <fullstop> holmes <comma> and our trail lay in this
 direction <fullstop> he turned his bulldog eyes upon our visitor <fullstop> are you mr <fullstop>
 john scott eccles <comma> of popham house <comma> lee <question>
 i am <fullstop>
 we have been following you about all the morning <fullstop>
 you traced him through the telegram <comma> no doubt <comma> said holmes <fullstop> 
 exactly <comma> mr <fullstop> holmes <fullstop> we picked up the scent at charing cross
 post-office and came on here <fullstop>
 but why do you follow me <question> what do you want <question>
 we wish a statement <comma> mr <fullstop> scott eccles <comma> as to the events which let up
 to the death last night of mr <fullstop> aloysius garcia <comma> of wisteria lodge <comma>
 near esher <fullstop>
 our client had sat up with staring eyes and every tinge of colour
 struck from his astonished face <fullstop>
 dead <question> did you say he was dead <question>
 yes <comma> sir <comma> he is dead <fullstop>
 but how <question> an accident <question>
 murder <comma> if ever there was one upon earth <fullstop>
 good god this is awful you dont mean--you dont mean that i am
 suspected <question>
 a letter of yours was found in the dead mans pocket <comma> and we know by
 it that you had planned to pass last night at his house <fullstop>
 so i did <fullstop>
 oh <comma> you did <comma> did you <question>
 out came the official notebook <fullstop>
 plain statement <comma> is it not <question>
 and it is my duty to warn mr <fullstop> scott eccles that it may be used
 against him <fullstop>
 mr <fullstop> eccles was going to tell us about it when you entered the room <fullstop>
 i think <comma> watson <comma> a brandy and soda would do him no harm <fullstop> now <comma> sir <comma> i
 suggest that you take no notice of this addition to your audience <comma>
 and that you proceed with your narrative exactly as you would have
 done had you never been interrupted <fullstop>
 our visitor had gulped off the brandy and the colour had returned to
 his face <fullstop> with a dubious glance at the inspectors notebook <comma> he
 plunged at once into his extraordinary statement <fullstop>
 i am a bachelor <comma> said he <comma> and being of a sociable turn i cultivate
 a large number of friends <fullstop> among these are the family of a retired
 brewer called melville <comma> living at abermarle mansion <comma> kensington <fullstop> it
 was at his table that i met some weeks ago a young fellow named
 garcia <fullstop> he was <comma> i understood <comma> of spanish descent and connected in
 some way with the embassy <fullstop> he spoke perfect english <comma> was pleasing in
 his manners <comma> and as good-looking a man as ever i saw in my life <fullstop>
 in some way we struck up quite a friendship <comma> this young fellow and
 i <fullstop> he seemed to take a fancy to me from the first <comma> and within two
 days of our meeting he came to see me at lee <fullstop> one thing led to
 another <comma> and it ended in his inviting me out to spend a few days at
 his house <comma> wisteria lodge <comma> between esher and oxshott <fullstop> yesterday
 evening i went to esher to fulfil this engagement <fullstop>
 he had described his household to me before i went there <fullstop> he lived
 with a faithful servant <comma> a countryman of his own <comma> who looked after
 all his needs <fullstop> this fellow could speak english and did his
 housekeeping for him <fullstop> then there was a wonderful cook <comma> he said <comma> a
 half-breed whom he had picked up in his travels <comma> who could serve an
 excellent dinner <fullstop> i remember that he remarked what a queer household
 it was to find in the heart of surrey <comma> and that i agreed with him <comma>
 though it has proved a good deal queerer than i thought <fullstop>
 i drove to the place--about two miles on the south side of esher <fullstop>
 the house was a fair-sized one <comma> standing back from the road <comma> with a
 curving drive which was banked with high evergreen shrubs <fullstop> it was an
 old <comma> tumbledown building in a crazy state of disrepair <fullstop> when the trap
 pulled up on the grass-grown drive in front of the blotched and
 weather-stained door <comma> i had doubts as to my wisdom in visiting a man
 whom i knew so slightly <fullstop> he opened the door himself <comma> however <comma> and
 greeted me with a great show of cordiality <fullstop> i was handed over to the
 manservant <comma> a melancholy <comma> swarthy individual <comma> who led the way <comma> my bag
 in his hand <comma> to my bedroom <fullstop> the whole place was depressing <fullstop> our
 dinner was tte--tte <comma> and though my host did his best to be
 entertaining <comma> his thoughts seemed to continually wander <comma> and he
 talked so vaguely and wildly that i could hardly understand him <fullstop> he
 continually drummed his fingers on the table <comma> gnawed his nails <comma> and
 gave other signs of nervous impatience <fullstop> the dinner itself was neither
 well served nor well cooked <comma> and the gloomy presence of the taciturn
 servant did not help to enliven us <fullstop> i can assure you that many times
 in the course of the evening i wished that i could invent some excuse
 which would take me back to lee <fullstop>
 one thing comes back to my memory which may have a bearing upon the
 business that you two gentlemen are investigating <fullstop> i thought nothing
 of it at the time <fullstop> near the end of dinner a note was handed in by the
 servant <fullstop> i noticed that after my host had read it he seemed even more
 distrait and strange than before <fullstop> he gave up all pretence at
 conversation and sat <comma> smoking endless cigarettes <comma> lost in his own
 thoughts <comma> but he made no remark as to the contents <fullstop> about eleven i
 was glad to go to bed <fullstop> some time later garcia looked in at my
 door--the room was dark at the time--and asked me if i had rung <fullstop> i
 said that i had not <fullstop> he apologized for having disturbed me so late <comma>
 saying that it was nearly one oclock <fullstop> i dropped off after this and
 slept soundly all night <fullstop>
 broad daylight <fullstop> i glanced at my watch <comma> and the time was nearly nine <fullstop>
 astonished at this forgetfulness <fullstop> i sprang up and rang for the
 servant <fullstop> there was no response <fullstop> i rang again and again <comma> with the same
 result <fullstop> then i came to the conclusion that the bell was out of order <fullstop>
 i huddled on my clothes and hurried downstairs in an exceedingly bad
 temper to order some hot water <fullstop> you can imagine my surprise when i
 found that there was no one there <fullstop> i shouted in the hall <fullstop> there was
 no answer <fullstop> then i ran from room to room <fullstop> all were deserted <fullstop> my host
 had shown me which was his bedroom the night before <comma> so i knocked at
 the door <fullstop> no reply <fullstop> i turned the handle and walked in <fullstop> the room was
 empty <comma> and the bed had never been slept in <fullstop> he had gone with the
 rest <fullstop> the foreign host <comma> the foreign footman <comma> the foreign cook <comma> all
 had vanished in the night that was the end of my visit to wisteria
 lodge <fullstop>
 bizarre incident to his collection of strange episodes <fullstop>
 your experience is <comma> so far as i know <comma> perfectly unique <comma> said he <fullstop>
 may i ask <comma> sir <comma> what you did then <question>
 i was furious <fullstop> my first idea was that i had been the victim of some
 absurd practical joke <fullstop> i packed my things <comma> banged the hall door
 behind me <comma> and set off for esher <comma> with my bag in my hand <fullstop> i called at
 allan brothers <comma> the chief land agents in the village <comma> and found that
 it was from this firm that the villa had been rented <fullstop> it struck me
 that the whole proceeding could hardly be for the purpose of making a
 fool of me <comma> and that the main objet must be to get out of the rent <fullstop>
 it is late in march <comma> so quarter-day is at hand <fullstop> but this theory would
 not work <fullstop> the agent was obliged to me for my warning <comma> but told me
 that the rent had been paid in advance <fullstop> then i made my way to town
 and called at the spanish embassy <fullstop> the man was unknown there <fullstop> after
 this i went to see melville <comma> at whose house i had first met garcia <comma>
 but i found that he really knew rather less about him than i did <fullstop>
 finally when i got your reply to my wire i came out to you <comma> since i
 gather that you are a person who gives advice in difficult cases <fullstop> but
 now <comma> mr <fullstop> inspector <comma> i understand <comma> from what you said when you entered
 the room <comma> that you can carry the story on <comma> and that some tragedy had
 occurred <fullstop> i can assure you that every word i have said is the truth <comma>
 and that <comma> outside of what i have told you <comma> i know absolutely nothing
 about the fate of this man <fullstop> my only desire is to help the law in
 every possible way <fullstop>
 i am sure of it <comma> mr <fullstop> scott eccles--i am sure of it <comma> said inspector
 gregson in a very amiable tone <fullstop> i am bound to say that everything
 which you have said agrees very closely with the facts as they have
 come to our notice <fullstop> for example <comma> there was that note which arrived
 during dinner <fullstop> did you chance to observe what became of it <question>
 yes <comma> i did <fullstop> garcia rolled it up and threw it into the fire <fullstop>
 what do you say to that <comma> mr <fullstop> baynes <question>
 the country detective was a stout <comma> puffy <comma> red man <comma> whose face was
 only redeemed from grossness by two extraordinarily bright eyes <comma>
 almost hidden behind the heavy creases of cheek and brow <fullstop> with a slow
 smile he drew a folded and discoloured scrap of paper from his
 pocket <fullstop>
 it was a dog-grate <comma> mr <fullstop> holmes <comma> and he overpitched it <fullstop> i picked this
 out unburned from the back of it <fullstop>
 holmes smiled his appreciation <fullstop>
 you must have examined the house very carefully to find a single
 pellet of paper <fullstop>
 i did <comma> mr <fullstop> holmes <fullstop> its my way <fullstop> shall i read it <comma> mr <fullstop> gregson <question>
 the londoner nodded <fullstop>
 the note is written upon ordinary cream-laid paper without
 watermark <fullstop> it is a quarter-sheet <fullstop> the paper is cut off in two snips
 with a short-bladed scissors <fullstop> it has been folded over three times and
 sealed with purple wax <comma> put on hurriedly and pressed down with some
 flat oval object <fullstop> it is addressed to mr <fullstop> garcia <comma> wisteria lodge <fullstop> it
 says
 our own colours <comma> green and white <fullstop> green open <comma> white shut <fullstop> main
 stair <comma> first corridor <comma> seventh right <comma> green baize <fullstop> godspeed <fullstop>
 d <fullstop>
 it is a womans writing <comma> done with a sharp-pointed pen <comma> but the
 address is either done with another pen or by someone else <fullstop> it is
 thicker and bolder <comma> as you see <fullstop>
 a very remarkable note <comma> said holmes <comma> glancing it over <fullstop> i must
 compliment you <comma> mr <fullstop> baynes <comma> upon your attention to detail in your
 examination of it <fullstop> a few trifling points might perhaps be added <fullstop> the
 oval seal is undoubtedly a plain sleeve-link--what else is of such a
 shape <question> the scissors were bent nail scissors <fullstop> short as the two snips
 are <comma> you can distinctly see the same slight curve in each <fullstop>
 the country detective chuckled <fullstop>
 i thought i had squeezed all the juice out of it <comma> but i see there
 was a little over <comma> he said <fullstop> im bound to say that i make nothing of
 the note except that there was something on hand <comma> and that a woman <comma>
 as usual <comma> was at the bottom of it <fullstop>
 mr <fullstop> scott eccles had fidgeted in his seat during this conversation <fullstop>
 i am glad you found the note <comma> since it corroborates my story <comma> said
 he <fullstop> but i beg to point out that i have not yet heard what has
 happened to mr <fullstop> garcia <comma> nor what has become of his household <fullstop>
 as to garcia <comma> said gregson <comma> that is easily answered <fullstop> he was found
 dead this morning upon oxshott common <comma> nearly a mile from his home <fullstop>
 his head had been smashed to pulp by heavy blows of a sandbag or some
 such instrument <comma> which had crushed rather than wounded <fullstop> it is a
 lonely corner <comma> and there is no house within a quarter of a mile of
 the spot <fullstop> he had apparently been struck down first from behind <comma> but
 his assailant had gone on beating him long after he was dead <fullstop> it was
 a most furious assault <fullstop> there are no footsteps nor any clue to the
 criminals <fullstop>
 robbed <question>
 no <comma> there was no attempt at robbery <fullstop>
 this is very painful--very painful and terrible <comma> said mr <fullstop> scott
 eccles in a querulous voice <comma> but it is really uncommonly hard on me <fullstop>
 i had nothing to do with my host going off upon a nocturnal excursion
 and meeting so sad an end <fullstop> how do i come to be mixed up with the
 case <question>
 very simply <comma> sir <comma> inspector baynes answered <fullstop> the only document
 found in the pocket of the deceased was a letter from you saying that
 you would be with him on the night of his death <fullstop> it was the envelope
 of this letter which gave us the dead mans name and address <fullstop> it was
 after nine this morning when we reached his house and found neither
 you nor anyone else inside it <fullstop> i wired to mr <fullstop> gregson to run you down
 in london while i examined wisteria lodge <fullstop> then i came into town <comma>
 joined mr <fullstop> gregson <comma> and here we are <fullstop>
 i think now <comma> said gregson <comma> rising <comma> we had best put this matter
 into an official shape <fullstop> you will come round with us to the station <comma>
 mr <fullstop> scott eccles <comma> and let us have your statement in writing <fullstop>
 certainly <comma> i will come at once <fullstop> but i retain your services <comma> mr <fullstop>
 holmes <fullstop> i desire you to spare no expense and no pains to get at the
 truth <fullstop>
 my friend turned to the country inspector <fullstop>
 i suppose that you have no objection to my collaborating with you <comma>
 mr <fullstop> baynes <question>
 highly honoured <comma> sir <comma> i am sure <fullstop>
 you appear to have been very prompt and businesslike in all that you
 have done <fullstop> was there any clue <comma> may i ask <comma> as to the exact hour that
 the man met his death <question>
 he had been there since one oclock <fullstop> there was rain about that time <comma>
 and his death had certainly been before the rain <fullstop>
 but that is perfectly impossible <comma> mr <fullstop> baynes <comma> cried our client <fullstop>
 his voice is unmistakable <fullstop> i could swear to it that it was he who
 addressed me in my bedroom at that very hour <fullstop>
 remarkable <comma> but by no means impossible <comma> said holmes <comma> smiling <fullstop>
 you have a clue <question> asked gregson <fullstop>
 on the face of it the case is not a very complex one <comma> though it
 certainly presents some novel and interesting features <fullstop> a further
 knowledge of facts is necessary before i would venture to give a
 final and definite opinion <fullstop> by the way <comma> mr <fullstop> baynes <comma> did you find
 anything remarkable besides this note in your examination of the
 house <question>
 the detective looked at my friend in a singular way <fullstop>
 there were <comma> said he <comma> one or two very remarkable things <fullstop> perhaps
 when i have finished at the police-station you would care to come out
 and give me your opinion of them <fullstop>
 bell <fullstop> you will show these gentlemen out <comma> mrs <fullstop> hudson <comma> and kindly
 send the boy with this telegram <fullstop> he is to pay a five-shilling reply <fullstop>
 we sat for some time in silence after our visitors had left <fullstop> holmes
 smoked hard <comma> with his browns drawn down over his keen eyes <comma> and his
 head thrust forward in the eager way characteristic of the man <fullstop>
 well <comma> watson <comma> he asked <comma> turning suddenly upon me <comma> what do you make
 of it <question>
 i can make nothing of this mystification of scott eccles <fullstop>
 but the crime <question>
 well <comma> taken with the disappearance of the mans companions <comma> i should
 say that they were in some way concerned in the murder and had fled
 from justice <fullstop>
 that is certainly a possible point of view <fullstop> on the face of it you
 must admit <comma> however <comma> that it is very strange that his two servants
 should have been in a conspiracy against him and should have attacked
 him on the one night when he had a guest <fullstop> they had him alone at their
 mercy every other night in the week <fullstop>
 then why did they fly <question>
 quite so <fullstop> why did they fly <question> there is a big fact <fullstop> another big fact is
 the remarkable experience of our client <comma> scott eccles <fullstop> now <comma> my dear
 watson <comma> is it beyond the limits of human ingenuity to furnish an
 explanation which would cover both of these big facts <question> if it were one
 which would also admit of the mysterious note with its very curious
 phraseology <comma> why <comma> then it would be worth accepting as a temporary
 hypothesis <fullstop> if the fresh facts which come to our knowledge all fit
 themselves into the scheme <comma> then our hypothesis may gradually become
 a solution <fullstop>
 but what is our hypothesis <question>
 holmes leaned back in his chair with half-closed eyes <fullstop>
 you must admit <comma> my dear watson <comma> that the idea of a joke is
 impossible <fullstop> there were grave events afoot <comma> as the sequel showed <comma> and
 the coaxing of scott eccles to wisteria lodge had some connection
 with them <fullstop>
 but what possible connection <question>
 let us take it link by link <fullstop> there is <comma> on the face of it <comma> something
 unnatural about this strange and sudden friendship between the young
 spaniard and scott eccles <fullstop> it was the former who forced the pace <fullstop> he
 called upon eccles at the other end of london on the very day after
 he first met him <comma> and he kept in close touch with him until he got
 him down to esher <fullstop> now <comma> what did he want with eccles <question> what could
 intelligent--not a man likely to be congenial to a quick-witted
 latin <fullstop> why <comma> then <comma> was he picked out from all the other people whom
 outstanding quality <question> i say that he has <fullstop> he is the very type of
 conventional british respectability <comma> and the very man as a witness to
 impress another briton <fullstop> you saw yourself how neither of the
 inspectors dreamed of questioning his statement <comma> extraordinary as it
 was <fullstop>
 but what was he to witness <question>
 nothing <comma> as things turned out <comma> but everything had they gone another
 way <fullstop> that is how i read the matter <fullstop>
 i see <comma> he might have proved an alibi <fullstop>
 exactly <comma> my dear watson he might have proved an alibi <fullstop> we will
 suppose <comma> for arguments sake <comma> that the household of wisteria lodge
 are confederates in some design <fullstop> the attempt <comma> whatever it may be <comma> is
 to come off <comma> we will say <comma> before one oclock <fullstop> by some juggling of the
 clocks it is quite possible that they may have got scott eccles to
 bed earlier than he thought <comma> but in any case it is likely that when
 garcia went out of his way to tell him that it was one it was really
 not more than twelve <fullstop> if garcia could do whatever he had to do and be
 back by the hour mentioned he had evidently a powerful reply to any
 accusation <fullstop> here was this irreproachable englishman ready to swear in
 any court of law that the accused was in the house all the time <fullstop> it
 was an insurance against the worst <fullstop>
 yes <comma> yes <comma> i see that <fullstop> but how about the disappearance of the
 others <question>
 i have not all my facts yet <comma> but i do not think there are any
 insuperable difficulties <fullstop> still <comma> it is an error to argue in front of
 your data <fullstop> you find yourself insensibly twisting them round to fit
 your theories <fullstop>
 and the message <question>
 how did it run <question> our own colours <comma> green and white <fullstop> sounds like
 racing <fullstop> green open <comma> white shut <fullstop> that is clearly a signal <fullstop> main
 stair <comma> first corridor <comma> seventh right <comma> green baize <fullstop> this is an
 assignation <fullstop> we may find a jealous husband at the bottom of it all <fullstop>
 it was clearly a dangerous quest <fullstop> she would not have said godspeed
 had it not been so <fullstop> d--that should be a guide <fullstop>
 the man was a spaniard <fullstop> i suggest that d stands for dolores <comma> a
 common female name in spain <fullstop>
 good <comma> watson <comma> very good--but quite inadmissable <fullstop> a spaniard would
 write to a spaniard in spanish <fullstop> the writer of this note is certainly
 english <fullstop> well <comma> we can only possess our soul in patience until this
 excellent inspector come back for us <fullstop> meanwhile we can thank our
 lucky fate which has rescued us for a few short hours from the
 insufferable fatigues of idleness <fullstop>
 an answer had arrived to holmess telegram before our surrey officer
 had returned <fullstop> holmes read it and was about to place it in his
 notebook when he caught a glimpse of my expectant face <fullstop> he tossed it
 across with a laugh <fullstop>
 we are moving in exalted circles <comma> said he <fullstop>
 the telegram was a list of names and addresses
 lord harringby <comma> the dingle sir george ffolliott <comma> oxshott towers mr <fullstop>
 hynes hynes <comma> j <fullstop>p <fullstop> <comma> purdley place mr <fullstop> james baker williams <comma> forton
 old hall mr <fullstop> henderson <comma> high gable rev <fullstop> joshua stone <comma> nether
 walsling <fullstop>
 this is a very obvious way of limiting our field of operations <comma>
 said holmes <fullstop> no doubt baynes <comma> with his methodical mind <comma> has already
 adopted some similar plan <fullstop>
 i dont quite understand <fullstop>
 well <comma> my dear fellow <comma> we have already arrived at the conclusion that
 the massage received by garcia at dinner was an appointment or an
 assignation <fullstop> now <comma> if the obvious reading of it is correct <comma> and in
 order to keep the tryst one has to ascend a main stair and seek the
 seventh door in a corridor <comma> it is perfectly clear that the house is a
 very large one <fullstop> it is equally certain that this house cannot be more
 than a mile or two from oxshott <comma> since garcia was walking in that
 direction and hoped <comma> according to my reading of the facts <comma> to be back
 in wisteria lodge in time to avail himself of an alibi <comma> which would
 only be valid up to one oclock <fullstop> as the number of large houses close
 to oxshott must be limited <comma> i adopted the obvious method of sending
 to the agents mentioned by scott eccles and obtaining a list of them <fullstop>
 here they are in this telegram <comma> and the other end of our tangled
 skein must lie among them <fullstop>
 it was nearly six oclock before we found ourselves in the pretty
 surrey village of esher <comma> with inspector baynes as our companion <fullstop>
 holmes and i had taken things for the night <comma> and found comfortable
 quarters at the bull <fullstop> finally we set out in the company of the
 detective on our visit to wisteria lodge <fullstop> it was a cold <comma> dark march
 evening <comma> with a sharp wind and a fine rain beating upon our faces <comma> a
 fit setting for the wild common over which our road passed and the
 tragic goal to which it led us <fullstop>
 the tiger of san pedro
 a cold and melancholy walk of a couple of miles brought us to a high
 wooden gate <comma> which opened into a gloomy avenue of chestnuts <fullstop> the
 curved and shadowed drive led us to a low <comma> dark house <comma> pitch-black
 against a slate-coloured sky <fullstop> from the front window upon the left of
 the door there peeped a glimmer of a feeble light <fullstop>
 theres a constable in possession <comma> said baynes <fullstop> ill knock at the
 window <fullstop> he stepped across the grass plot and tapped with his hand on
 the pane <fullstop> through the fogged glass i dimly saw a man spring up from a
 chair beside the fire <comma> and heard a sharp cry from within the room <fullstop> an
 instant later a white-faced <comma> hard-breathing policeman had opened the
 door <comma> the candle wavering in his trembling hand <fullstop>
 whats the matter <comma> walters <question> asked baynes sharply <fullstop>
 the man mopped his forehead with his handkerchief and agave a long
 sigh of relief <fullstop>
 i am glad you have come <comma> sir <fullstop> it has been a long evening <comma> and i
 dont think my nerve is as good as it was <fullstop>
 your nerve <comma> walters <question> i should not have thought you had a nerve in
 your body <fullstop>
 well <comma> sir <comma> its this lonely <comma> silent house and the queer thing in the
 kitchen <fullstop> then when you tapped at the window i thought it had come
 again <fullstop>
 that what had come again <question>
 the devil <comma> sir <comma> for all i know <fullstop> it was at the window <fullstop>
 what was at the window <comma> and when <question>
 it was just about two hours ago <fullstop> the light was just fading <fullstop> i was
 sitting reading in the chair <fullstop> i dont know what made me look up <comma> but
 there was a face looking in at me through the lower pane <fullstop> lord <comma> sir <comma>
 what a face it was ill see it in my dreams <fullstop>
 tut <comma> tut <comma> walters <fullstop> this is not talk for a police-constable <fullstop>
 i know <comma> sir <comma> i know but it shook me <comma> sir <comma> and theres no use to
 deny it <fullstop> it wasnt black <comma> sir <comma> nor was it white <comma> nor any colour that
 i know but a kind of queer shade like clay with a splash of milk in
 it <fullstop> then there was the size of it--it was twice yours <comma> sir <fullstop> and the
 look of it--the great staring goggle eyes <comma> and the line of white
 teeth like a hungry beast <fullstop> i tell you <comma> sir <comma> i couldnt move a finger <comma>
 nor get my breath <comma> till it whisked away and was gone <fullstop> out i ran and
 through the shrubbery <comma> but thank god there was no one there <fullstop>
 if i didnt know you were a good man <comma> walters <comma> i should put a black
 mark against you for this <fullstop> if it were the devil himself a constable
 on duty should never thank god that he could not lay his hands upon
 him <fullstop> i suppose the whole thing is not a vision and a touch of
 nerves <question>
 that <comma> at least <comma> is very easily settled <comma> said holmes <comma> lighting his
 little pocket lantern <fullstop> yes <comma> he reported <comma> after a short examination
 of the grass bed <comma> a number twelve shoe <comma> i should say <fullstop> if he was all
 on the same scale as his foot he must certainly have been a giant <fullstop>
 what became of him <question>
 he seems to have broken through the shrubbery and made for the
 road <fullstop>
 well <comma> said the inspector with a grave and thoughtful face <comma> whoever
 he may have been <comma> and whatever he may have wanted <comma> hes gone for the
 present <comma> and we have more immediate things to attend to <fullstop> now <comma> mr <fullstop>
 holmes <comma> with your permission <comma> i will show you round the house <fullstop>
 the various bedrooms and sitting-rooms had yielded nothing to a
 careful search <fullstop> apparently the tenants had brought little or nothing
 with them <comma> and all the furniture down to the smallest details had
 been taken over with the house <fullstop> a good deal of clothing with the
 stamp of marx and co <fullstop> <comma> high holborn <comma> had been left behind <fullstop>
 telegraphic inquiries had been already made which showed that marx
 knew nothing of his customer save that he was a good payer <fullstop> odds and
 ends <comma> some pipes <comma> a few novels <comma> two of them in spanish <comma> and
 old-fashioned pinfire revolver <comma> and a guitar were among the personal
 property <fullstop>
 nothing in all this <comma> said baynes <comma> stalking <comma> candle in hand <comma> from
 room to room <fullstop> but now <comma> mr <fullstop> holmes <comma> i invite your attention to the
 kitchen <fullstop>
 it was a gloomy <comma> high-ceilinged room at the back of the house <comma> with a
 straw litter in one corner <comma> which served apparently as a bed for the
 cook <fullstop> the table was piled with half-eaten dishes and dirty plates <comma>
 the debris of last nights dinner <fullstop>
 look at this <comma> said baynes <fullstop> what do you make of it <question>
 he held up his candle before an extraordinary object which stood at
 the back of the dresser <fullstop> it was so wrinkled and shrunken and withered
 that it was difficult to say what it might have been <fullstop> one could but
 say that it was black and leathery and that it bore some resemblance
 to a dwarfish <comma> human figure <fullstop> at first <comma> as i examined it <comma> i thought
 that it was a mummified negro baby <comma> and then it seemed a very twisted
 and ancient monkey <fullstop> finally i was left in doubt as to whether it was
 animal or human <fullstop> a double band of white shells were strung round the
 centre of it <fullstop>
 very interesting--very interesting <comma> indeed said holmes <comma> peering at
 this sinister relic <fullstop> anything more <question>
 in silence baynes led the way to the sink and held forward his
 candle <fullstop> the limbs and body of some large <comma> white bird <comma> torn savagely
 to pieces with the feathers still on <comma> were littered all over it <fullstop>
 holmes pointed to the wattles on the severed head <fullstop>
 a white cock <comma> said he <fullstop> most interesting it is really a very
 curious case <fullstop>
 but mr <fullstop> baynes had kept his most sinister exhibit to the last <fullstop> from
 under the sink he drew a zinc pail which contained a quantity of
 blood <fullstop> then from the table he took a platter heaped with small pieces
 of charred bone <fullstop>
 something has been killed and something has been burned <fullstop> we raked
 all these out of the fire <fullstop> we had a doctor in this morning <fullstop> he says
 that they are not human <fullstop>
 holmes smiled and rubbed his hands <fullstop>
 i must congratulate you <comma> inspector <comma> on handling so distinctive and
 instructive a case <fullstop> your powers <comma> if i may say so without offence <comma>
 seem superior to your opportunities <fullstop>
 inspector bayness small eyes twinkled with pleasure <fullstop>
 youre right <comma> mr <fullstop> holmes <fullstop> we stagnate in the provinces <fullstop> a case of
 this sort gives a man a chance <comma> and i hope that i shall take it <fullstop> what
 do you make of these bones <question>
 a lamb <comma> i should say <comma> or a kid <fullstop>
 and the white cock <question>
 curious <comma> mr <fullstop> baynes <comma> very curious <fullstop> i should say almost unique <fullstop>
 yes <comma> sir <comma> there must have been some very strange people with some
 very strange ways in this house <fullstop> one of them is dead <fullstop> did his
 companions follow him and kill him <question> if they did we should have them <comma>
 for every port is watched <fullstop> but my own views are different <fullstop> yes <comma> sir <comma>
 my own views are very different <fullstop>
 you have a theory then <question>
 and ill work it myself <comma> mr <fullstop> holmes <fullstop> its only due to my own credit
 to do so <fullstop> your name is made <comma> but i have still to make mine <fullstop> i should
 be glad to be able to say afterwards that i had solved it without
 your help <fullstop>
 holmes laughed good-humoredly <fullstop>
 well <comma> well <comma> inspector <comma> said he <fullstop> do you follow your path and i will
 follow mine <fullstop> my results are always very much at your service if you
 care to apply to me for them <fullstop> i think that i have seen all that i
 wish in this house <comma> and that my time may be more profitably employed
 elsewhere <fullstop> au revoir and good luck
 i could tell by numerous subtle signs <comma> which might have been lost
 upon anyone but myself <comma> that holmes was on a hot scent <fullstop> as impassive
 as ever to the casual observer <comma> there were none the less a subdued
 eagerness and suggestion of tension in his brightened eyes and
 brisker manner which assured me that the game was afoot <fullstop> after his
 habit he said nothing <comma> and after mine i asked no questions <fullstop>
 sufficient for me to share the sport and lend my humble help to the
 capture without distracting that intent brain with needless
 interruption <fullstop> all would come round to me in due time <fullstop>
 i waited <comma> therefore--but to my ever-deepening disappointment i waited
 in vain <fullstop> day succeeded day <comma> and my friend took no step forward <fullstop> one
 morning he spent in town <comma> and i learned from a casual reference that
 he had visited the british museum <fullstop> save for this one excursion <comma> he
 spent his days in long and often solitary walks <comma> or in chatting with
 a number of village gossips whose acquaintance he had cultivated <fullstop>
 im sure <comma> watson <comma> a week in the country will be invaluable to you <comma>
 he remarked <fullstop> it is very pleasant to see the first green shoots upon
 the hedges and the catkins on the hazels once again <fullstop> with a spud <comma> a
 tin box <comma> and an elementary book on botany <comma> there are instructive days
 to be spent <fullstop> he prowled about with this equipment himself <comma> but it
 was a poor show of plants which he would bring back of an evening <fullstop>
 occasionally in our rambles we came across inspector baynes <fullstop> his fat <comma>
 red face wreathed itself in smiles and his small eyes glittered as he
 greeted my companion <fullstop> he said little about the case <comma> but from that
 little we gathered that he also was not dissatisfied at the course of
 events <fullstop> i must admit <comma> however <comma> that i was somewhat surprised when <comma>
 some five days after the crime <comma> i opened my morning paper to find in
 large letters
 the oxshott mystery
 a solution
 arrest of supposed assassin
 holmes sprang in his chair as if he had been stung when i read the
 headlines <fullstop>
 by jove he cried <fullstop> you dont mean that baynes has got him <question>
 apparently <comma> said i as i read the following report
 great excitement was caused in esher and the neighbouring district
 when it was learned late last night that an arrest had been effected
 in connection with the oxshott murder <fullstop> it will be remembered that mr <fullstop>
 garcia <comma> of wisteria lodge <comma> was found dead on oxshott common <comma> his body
 showing signs of extreme violence <comma> and that on the same night his
 in the crime <fullstop> it was suggested <comma> but never proved <comma> that the deceased
 gentleman may have had valuables in the house <comma> and that their
 abstraction was the motive of the crime <fullstop> every effort was made by
 inspector baynes <comma> who has the case in hand <comma> to ascertain the hiding
 place of the fugitives <comma> and he had good reason to believe that they
 had not gone far but were lurking in some retreat which had been
 already prepared <fullstop> it was certain from the first <comma> however <comma> that they
 would eventually be detected <comma> as the cook <comma> from the evidence of one
 or two tradespeople who have caught a glimpse of him through the
 window <comma> was a man of most remarkable appearance--being a huge and
 hideous mulatto <comma> with yellowish features of a pronounced negroid
 type <fullstop> this man has been seen since the crime <comma> for he was detected and
 pursued by constable walters on the same evening <comma> when he had the
 audacity to revisit wisteria lodge <fullstop> inspector baynes <comma> considering
 that such a visit must have some purpose in view and was likely <comma>
 therefore <comma> to be repeated <comma> abandoned the house but left an ambuscade
 in the shrubbery <fullstop> the man walked into the trap and was captured last
 night after a struggle in which constable downing was badly bitten by
 the savage <fullstop> we understand that when the prison is brought before the
 magistrates a remand will be applied for by the police <comma> and that
 great developments are hoped from his capture <fullstop>
 really we must see baynes at once <comma> cried holmes <comma> picking up his
 hat <fullstop> we will just catch him before he starts <fullstop> we hurried down the
 village street and found <comma> as we had expected <comma> that the inspector was
 just leaving his lodgings <fullstop>
 youve seen the paper <comma> mr <fullstop> holmes <question> he asked <comma> holding one out to us <fullstop>
 yes <comma> baynes <comma> ive seen it <fullstop> pray dont think it a liberty if i give
 you a word of friendly warning <fullstop>
 of warning <comma> mr <fullstop> holmes <question>
 i have looked into this case with some care <comma> and i am not convinced
 that you are on the right lines <fullstop> i dont want you to commit yourself
 too far unless you are sure <fullstop>
 youre very kind <comma> mr <fullstop> holmes <fullstop>
 i assure you i speak for your good <fullstop>
 it seemed to me that something like a wink quivered for an instant
 over one of mr <fullstop> bayness tiny eyes <fullstop>
 we agreed to work on our own lines <comma> mr <fullstop> holmes <fullstop> thats what i am
 doing <fullstop>
 oh <comma> very good <comma> said holmes <fullstop> dont blame me <fullstop>
 no <comma> sir i believe you mean well by me <fullstop> but we all have our own
 systems <comma> mr <fullstop> holmes <fullstop> you have yours <comma> and maybe i have mine <fullstop>
 let us say no more about it <fullstop>
 youre welcome always to my news <fullstop> this fellow is a perfect savage <comma>
 as strong as a cart-horse and as fierce as the devil <fullstop> he chewed
 downings thumb nearly off before they could master him <fullstop> he hardly
 speaks a word of english <comma> and we can get nothing out of him but
 grunts <fullstop>
 and you think you have evidence that he murdered his late master <question>
 i didnt say so <comma> mr <fullstop> holmes i didnt say so <fullstop> we all have our little
 ways <fullstop> you try yours and i will try mine <fullstop> thats the agreement <fullstop>
 holmes shrugged his shoulders as we walked away together <fullstop> i cant
 make the man out <fullstop> he seems to be riding for a fall <fullstop> well <comma> as he says <comma>
 we must each try our own way and see what comes of it <fullstop> but theres
 something in inspector baynes which i cant quite understand <fullstop>
 touch with the situation <comma> as i may need your help to-night <fullstop> let me
 show you the evolution of this case so far as i have been able to
 follow it <fullstop> simple as it has been in its leading features <comma> it has none
 the less presented surprising difficulties in the way of an arrest <fullstop>
 there are gaps in that direction which we have still to fill <fullstop>
 we will go back to the note which was handed in to garcia upon the
 evening of his death <fullstop> we may put aside this idea of bayness that
 garcias servants were concerned in the matter <fullstop> the proof of this
 lies in the fact that it was he who had arranged for the presence of
 scott eccles <comma> which could only have been done for the purpose of an
 alibi <fullstop> it was garcia <comma> then <comma> who had an enterprise <comma> and apparently a
 criminal enterprise <comma> in hand that night in the course of which he met
 his death <fullstop> i say criminal because only a man with a criminal
 enterprise desires to establish an alibi <fullstop> who <comma> then <comma> is most likely
 to have taken his life <question> surely the person against whom the criminal
 enterprise was directed <fullstop> so far it seems to me that we are on safe
 ground <fullstop>
 we can now see a reason for the disappearance of garcias household <fullstop>
 they were all confederates in the same unknown crime <fullstop> if it came off
 when garcia returned <comma> any possible suspicion would be warded off by
 the englishmans evidence <comma> and all would be well <fullstop> but the attempt was
 a dangerous one <comma> and if garcia did not return by a certain hour it
 was probable that his own life had been sacrificed <fullstop> it had been
 arranged <comma> therefore <comma> that in such a case his two subordinates were to
 make for some prearranged spot where they could escape investigation
 and be in a position afterwards to renew their attempt <fullstop> that would
 fully explain the facts <comma> would it not <question>
 the whole inexplicable tangle seemed to straighten out before me <fullstop> i
 wondered <comma> as i always did <comma> how it had not been obvious to me before <fullstop>
 but why should one servant return <question>
 we can imagine that in the confusion of flight something precious <comma>
 that would explain his persistence <comma> would it not <question>
 well <comma> what is the next step <question>
 the next step is the note received by garcia at the dinner <fullstop> it
 indicates a confederate at the other end <fullstop> now <comma> where was the other
 end <question> i have already shown you that it could only lie in some large
 house <comma> and that the number of large houses is limited <fullstop> my first days
 in this village were devoted to a series of walks in which in the
 intervals of my botanical researches i made a reconnaissance of all
 the large houses and an examination of the family history of the
 occupants <fullstop> one house <comma> and only one <comma> riveted my attention <fullstop> it is the
 famous old jacobean grange of high gable <comma> one mile on the farther
 side of oxshott <comma> and less than half a mile from the scene of the
 tragedy <fullstop> the other mansions belonged to prosaic and respectable
 people who live far aloof from romance <fullstop> but mr <fullstop> henderson <comma> of high
 gable <comma> was by all accounts a curious man to whom curious adventures
 might befall <fullstop> i concentrated my attention <comma> therefore <comma> upon him and
 his household <fullstop>
 a singular set of people <comma> watson--the man himself the most singular
 of them all <fullstop> i managed to see him on a plausible pretext <comma> but i
 seemed to read in his dark <comma> deepset <comma> brooding eyes that he was
 perfectly aware of my true business <fullstop> he is a man of fifty <comma> strong <comma>
 active <comma> with iron-gray hair <comma> great bunched black eyebrows <comma> the step
 of a deer and the air of an emperor--a fierce <comma> masterful man <comma> with a
 red-hot spirit behind his parchment face <fullstop> he is either a foreigner or
 has lived long in the tropics <comma> for he is yellow and sapless <comma> but
 tough as whipcord <fullstop> his friend and secretary <comma> mr <fullstop> lucas <comma> is
 undoubtedly a foreigner <comma> chocolate brown <comma> wily <comma> suave <comma> and catlike <comma>
 with a poisonous gentleness of speech <fullstop> you see <comma> watson <comma> we have come
 already upon two sets of foreigners--one at wisteria lodge and one at
 high gable--so our gaps are beginning to close <fullstop>
 these two men <comma> close and confidential friends <comma> are the centre of the
 household but there is one other person who for our immediate
 purpose may be even more important <fullstop> henderson has two children--girls
 of eleven and thirteen <fullstop> their governess is a miss burnet <comma> an
 englishwoman of forty or thereabouts <fullstop> there is also one confidential
 manservant <fullstop> this little group forms the real family <comma> for their travel
 about together <comma> and henderson is a great traveller <comma> always on the
 move <fullstop> it is only within the last weeks that he has returned <comma> after a
 years absence <comma> to high gable <fullstop> i may add that he is enormously rich <comma>
 and whatever his whims may be he can very easily satisfy them <fullstop> for
 the rest <comma> his house is full of butlers <comma> footmen <comma> maidservants <comma> and
 the usual overfed <comma> underworked staff of a large english country
 house <fullstop>
 observation <fullstop> there are no better instruments than discharged servants
 with a grievance <comma> and i was lucky enough to find one <fullstop> i call it luck <comma>
 but it would not have come my way had i not been looking out for it <fullstop>
 as baynes remarks <comma> we all have our systems <fullstop> it was my system which
 enabled me to find john warner <comma> late gardener of high gable <comma> sacked
 in a moment of temper by his imperious employer <fullstop> he in turn had
 friends among the indoor servants who unite in their fear and dislike
 of their master <fullstop> so i had my key to the secrets of the establishment <fullstop>
 curious people <comma> watson i dont pretend to understand it all yet <comma>
 but very curious people anyway <fullstop> its a double-winged house <comma> and the
 servants live on one side <comma> the family on the other <fullstop> theres no link
 between the two save for hendersons own servant <comma> who serves the
 familys meals <fullstop> everything is carried to a certain door <comma> which forms
 the one connection <fullstop> governess and children hardly go out at all <comma>
 except into the garden <fullstop> henderson never by any chance walks alone <fullstop>
 his dark secretary is like his shadow <fullstop> the gossip among the servants
 is that their master is terribly afraid of something <fullstop> sold his soul
 to the devil in exchange for money <comma> says warner <comma> and expects his
 creditor to come up and claim his own <fullstop> where they came from <comma> or who
 they are <comma> nobody has an idea <fullstop> they are very violent <fullstop> twice henderson
 has lashed at folk with his dog-whip <comma> and only his long purse and
 heavy compensation have kept him out of the courts <fullstop>
 well <comma> now <comma> watson <comma> let us judge the situation by this new
 information <fullstop> we may take it that the letter came out of this strange
 household and was an invitation to garcia to carry out some attempt
 which had already been planned <fullstop> who wrote the note <question> it was someone
 within the citadel <comma> and it was a woman <fullstop> who then but miss burnet <comma> the
 governess <question> all our reasoning seems to point that way <fullstop> at any rate <comma> we
 may take it as a hypothesis and see what consequences it would
 entail <fullstop> i may add that miss burnets age and character make it
 certain that my first idea that there might be a love interest in our
 story is out of the question <fullstop>
 if she wrote the note she was presumably the friend and confederate
 of garcia <fullstop> what <comma> then <comma> might she be expected to do if she heard of
 his death <question> if he met it in some nefarious enterprise her lips might
 be sealed <fullstop> still <comma> in her heart <comma> she must retain bitterness and hatred
 against those who had killed him and would presumably help so far as
 she could to have revenge upon them <fullstop> could we see her <comma> then and try
 to use her <question> that was my first thought <fullstop> but now we come to a sinister
 fact <fullstop> miss burnet has not been seen by any human eye since the night
 of the murder <fullstop> from that evening she has utterly vanished <fullstop> is she
 alive <question> has she perhaps met her end on the same night as the friend
 whom she had summoned <question> or is she merely a prisoner <question> there is the
 point which we still have to decide <fullstop>
 you will appreciate the difficulty of the situation <comma> watson <fullstop> there
 is nothing upon which we can apply for a warrant <fullstop> our whole scheme
 might seem fantastic if laid before a magistrate <fullstop> the womans
 disappearance counts for nothing <comma> since in that extraordinary
 household any member of it might be invisible for a week <fullstop> and yet she
 may at the present moment be in danger of her life <fullstop> all i can do is
 to watch the house and leave my agent <comma> warner <comma> on guard at the gates <fullstop>
 we cant let such a situation continue <fullstop> if the law can do nothing we
 must take the risk ourselves <fullstop>
 what do you suggest <question>
 i know which is her room <fullstop> it is accessible from the top of an
 outhouse <fullstop> my suggestion is that you and i go to-night and see if we
 can strike at the very heart of the mystery <fullstop>
 it was not <comma> i must confess <comma> a very alluring prospect <fullstop> the old house
 with its atmosphere of murder <comma> the singular and formidable
 inhabitants <comma> the unknown dangers of the approach <comma> and the fact that
 we were putting ourselves legally in a false position all combined to
 damp my ardour <fullstop> but there was something in the ice-cold reasoning of
 holmes which made it impossible to shrink from any adventure which he
 might recommend <fullstop> one knew that thus <comma> and only thus <comma> could a solution
 be found <fullstop> i clasped his hand in silence <comma> and the die was cast <fullstop>
 but it was not destined that our investigation should have so
 adventurous an ending <fullstop> it was about five oclock <comma> and the shadows of
 the march evening were beginning to fall <comma> when an excited rustic
 rushed into our room <fullstop>
 theyve gone <comma> mr <fullstop> holmes <fullstop> they went by the last train <fullstop> the lady
 broke away <comma> and ive got her in a cab downstairs <fullstop>
 excellent <comma> warner cried holmes <comma> springing to his feet <fullstop> watson <comma>
 the gaps are closing rapidly <fullstop>
 in the cab was a woman <comma> half-collapsed from nervous exhaustion <fullstop> she
 bore upon her aquiline and emaciated face the traces of some recent
 tragedy <fullstop> her head hung listlessly upon her breast <comma> but as she raised
 it and turned her dull eyes upon us i saw that her pupils were dark
 dots in the centre of the broad gray iris <fullstop> she was drugged with
 opium <fullstop>
 i watched at the gate <comma> same as you advised <comma> mr <fullstop> holmes <comma> said our
 emissary <comma> the discharged gardener <fullstop> when the carriage came out i
 followed it to the station <fullstop> she was like one walking in her sleep <comma>
 but when they tried to get her into the train she came to life and
 struggled <fullstop> they pushed her into the carriage <fullstop> she fought her way out
 forget the face at the carriage window as i led her away <fullstop> id have a
 short life if he had his way--the black-eyed <comma> scowling <comma> yellow
 devil <fullstop>
 we carried her upstairs <comma> laid her on the sofa <comma> and a couple of cups
 of the strongest coffee soon cleared her brain from the mists of the
 drug <fullstop> baynes had been summoned by holmes <comma> and the situation rapidly
 explained to him <fullstop>
 why <comma> sir <comma> youve got me the very evidence i want <comma> said the
 inspector warmly <comma> shaking my friend by the hand <fullstop> i was on the same
 scent as you from the first <fullstop>
 what you were after henderson <question>
 why <comma> mr <fullstop> holmes <comma> when you were crawling in the shrubbery at high
 gable i was up one of the trees in the plantation and saw you down
 below <fullstop> it was just who would get his evidence first <fullstop>
 then why did you arrest the mulatto <question>
 baynes chuckled <fullstop>
 i was sure henderson <comma> as he calls himself <comma> felt that he was
 suspected <comma> and that he would lie low and make no move so long as he
 thought he was in any danger <fullstop> i arrested the wrong man to make him
 believe that our eyes were off him <fullstop> i knew he would be likely to
 clear off then and give us a chance of getting at miss burnet <fullstop>
 holmes laid his hand upon the inspectors shoulder <fullstop>
 you will rise high in your profession <fullstop> you have instinct and
 intuition <comma> said he <fullstop>
 baynes flushed with pleasure <fullstop>
 ive had a plain-clothes man waiting at the station all the week <fullstop>
 wherever the high gable folk go he will keep them in sight <fullstop> but he
 must have been hard put to it when miss burnet broke away <fullstop> however <comma>
 your man picked her up <comma> and it all ends well <fullstop> we cant arrest without
 her evidence <comma> that is clear <comma> so the sooner we get a statement the
 better <fullstop>
 every minute she gets stronger <comma> said holmes <comma> glancing at the
 governess <fullstop> but tell me <comma> baynes <comma> who is this man henderson <question>
 henderson <comma> the inspector answered <comma> is don murillo <comma> once called the
 tiger of san pedro <fullstop>
 the tiger of san pedro the whole history of the man came back to me
 in a flash <fullstop> he had made his name as the most lewd and bloodthirsty
 tyrant that had ever governed any country with a pretence to
 civilization <fullstop> strong <comma> fearless <comma> and energetic <comma> he had sufficient
 virtue to enable him to impose his odious vices upon a cowering
 people for ten or twelve years <fullstop> his name was a terror through all
 central america <fullstop> at the end of that time there was a universal rising
 against him <fullstop> but he was as cunning as he was cruel <comma> and at the first
 whisper of coming trouble he had secretly conveyed his treasures
 aboard a ship which was manned by devoted adherents <fullstop> it was an empty
 palace which was stormed by the insurgents next day <fullstop> the dictator <comma>
 his two children <comma> his secretary <comma> and his wealth had all escaped them <fullstop>
 from that moment he had vanished from the world <comma> and his identity had
 been a frequent subject for comment in the european press <fullstop>
 yes <comma> sir <comma> don murillo <comma> the tiger of san pedro <comma> said baynes <fullstop> if you
 look it up you will find that the san pedro colours are green and
 white <comma> same as in the note <comma> mr <fullstop> holmes <fullstop> henderson he called himself <comma>
 but i traced him back <comma> paris and rome and madrid to barcelona <comma> where
 his ship came in in 86 <fullstop> theyve been looking for him all the time
 for their revenge <comma> but it is only now that they have begun to find
 him out <fullstop>
 they discovered him a year ago <comma> said miss burnet <comma> who had sat up
 and was now intently following the conversation <fullstop> once already his
 life has been attempted <comma> but some evil spirit shielded him <fullstop> now <comma>
 again <comma> it is the noble <comma> chivalrous garcia who has fallen <comma> while the
 monster goes safe <fullstop> but another will come <comma> and yet another <comma> until some
 day justice will be done that is as certain as the rise of
 to-morrows sun <fullstop> her thin hands clenched <comma> and her worn face blanched
 with the passion of her hatred <fullstop>
 but how come you into this matter <comma> miss burnet <question> asked holmes <fullstop> how
 can an english lady join in such a murderous affair <question>
 i join in it because there is no other way in the world by which
 justice can be gained <fullstop> what does the law of england care for the
 rivers of blood shed years ago in san pedro <comma> or for the shipload of
 treasure which this man has stolen <question> to you they are like crimes
 committed in some other planet <fullstop> but we know <fullstop> we have learned the
 truth in sorrow and in suffering <fullstop> to us there is no fiend in hell
 like juan murillo <comma> and no peace in life while his victims still cry
 for vengeance <fullstop>
 no doubt <comma> said holmes <comma> he was as you say <fullstop> i have heard that he was
 atrocious <fullstop> but how are you affected <question>
 i will tell you it all <fullstop> this villains policy was to murder <comma> on one
 pretext or another <comma> every man who showed such promise that he might
 in time come to be a dangerous rival <fullstop> my husband--yes <comma> my real name
 is signora victor durando--was the san pedro minister in london <fullstop> he
 met me and married me there <fullstop> a nobler man never lived upon earth <fullstop>
 unhappily <comma> murillo heard of his excellence <comma> recalled him on some
 pretext <comma> and had him shot <fullstop> with a premonition of his fate he had
 refused to take me with him <fullstop> his estates were confiscated <comma> and i was
 left with a pittance and a broken heart <fullstop>
 then came the downfall of the tyrant <fullstop> he escaped as you have just
 described <fullstop> but the many whose lives he had ruined <comma> whose nearest and
 dearest had suffered torture and death at his hands <comma> would not let
 the matter rest <fullstop> they banded themselves into a society which should
 had discovered in the transformed henderson the fallen despot <comma> to
 attach myself to his household and keep the others in touch with his
 movements <fullstop> this i was able to do by securing the position of
 governess in his family <fullstop> he little knew that the woman who faced him
 at every meal was the woman whose husband he had hurried at an hours
 notice into eternity <fullstop> i smiled on him <comma> did my duty to his children <comma>
 and bided my time <fullstop> an attempt was made in paris and failed <fullstop> we
 zig-zagged swiftly here and there over europe to throw off the
 pursuers and finally returned to this house <comma> which he had taken upon
 his first arrival in england <fullstop>
 but here also the ministers of justice were waiting <fullstop> knowing that he
 would return there <comma> garcia <comma> who is the son of the former highest
 dignitary in san pedro <comma> was waiting with two trusty companions of
 humble station <comma> all three fired with the same reasons for revenge <fullstop> he
 could do little during the day <comma> for murillo took every precaution and
 never went out save with his satellite lucas <comma> or lopez as he was
 known in the days of his greatness <fullstop> at night <comma> however <comma> he slept
 alone <comma> and the avenger might find him <fullstop> on a certain evening <comma> which
 had been prearranged <comma> i sent my friend final instructions <comma> for the
 man was forever on the alert and continually changed his room <fullstop> i was
 to see that the doors were open and the signal of a green or white
 light in a window which faced the drive was to give notice if all was
 safe or if the attempt had better be postponed <fullstop>
 but everything went wrong with us <fullstop> in some way i had excited the
 suspicion of lopez <comma> the secretary <fullstop> he crept up behind me and sprang
 upon me just as i had finished the note <fullstop> he and his master dragged me
 to my room and held judgment upon me as a convicted traitress <fullstop> then
 and there they would have plunged their knives into me could they
 have seen how to escape the consequences of the deed <fullstop> finally <comma> after
 much debate <comma> they concluded that my murder was too dangerous <fullstop> but
 they determined to get rid forever of garcia <fullstop> they had gagged me <comma> and
 murillo twisted my arm round until i gave him the address <fullstop> i swear
 that he might have twisted it off had i understood what it would mean
 to garcia <fullstop> lopez addressed the note which i had written <comma> sealed it
 with his sleeve-link <comma> and sent it by the hand of the servant <comma> jose <fullstop>
 how they murdered him i do not know <comma> save that it was murillos hand
 who struck him down <comma> for lopez had remained to guard me <fullstop> i believe he
 must have waited among the gorse bushes through which the path winds
 and struck him down as he passed <fullstop> at first they were of a mind to let
 him enter the house and to kill him as a detected burglar but they
 argued that if they were mixed up in an inquiry their own identity
 would at once be publicly disclosed and they would be open to further
 attacks <fullstop> with the death of garcia <comma> the pursuit might cease <comma> since
 such a death might frighten others from the task <fullstop>
 all would now have been well for them had it not been for my
 knowledge of what they had done <fullstop> i have no doubt that there were
 times when my life hung in the balance <fullstop> i was confined to my room <comma>
 terrorized by the most horrible threats <comma> cruelly ill-used to break my
 spirit--see this stab on my shoulder and the bruises from end to end
 of my arms--and a gag was thrust into my mouth on the one occasion
 when i tried to call from the window <fullstop> for five days this cruel
 imprisonment continued <comma> with hardly enough food to hold body and soul
 together <fullstop> this afternoon a good lunch was brought me <comma> but the moment
 after i took it i knew that i had been drugged <fullstop> in a sort of dream i
 remember being half-led <comma> half-carried to the carriage in the same
 state i was conveyed to the train <fullstop> only then <comma> when the wheels were
 almost moving <comma> did i suddenly realize that my liberty lay in my own
 hands <fullstop> i sprang out <comma> they tried to drag me back <comma> and had it not been
 for the help of this good man <comma> who led me to the cab <comma> i should never
 had broken away <fullstop> now <comma> thank god <comma> i am beyond their power forever <fullstop>
 we had all listened intently to this remarkable statement <fullstop> it was
 holmes who broke the silence <fullstop>
 our difficulties are not over <comma> he remarked <comma> shaking his head <fullstop> our
 police work ends <comma> but our legal work begins <fullstop>
 exactly <comma> said i <fullstop> a plausible lawyer could make it out as an act of
 self-defence <fullstop> there may be a hundred crimes in the background <comma> but it
 is only on this one that they can be tried <fullstop>
 come <comma> come <comma> said baynes cheerily <comma> i think better of the law than
 that <fullstop> self-defence is one thing <fullstop> to entice a man in cold blood with
 the object of murdering him is another <comma> whatever danger you may fear
 from him <fullstop> no <comma> no <comma> we shall all be justified when we see the tenants
 of high gable at the next guildford assizes <fullstop>
 it is a matter of history <comma> however <comma> that a little time was still to
 elapse before the tiger of san pedro should meet with his deserts <fullstop>
 wily and bold <comma> he and his companion threw their pursuer off their
 track by entering a lodging-house in edmonton street and leaving by
 the back-gate into curzon square <fullstop> from that day they were seen no
 more in england <fullstop> some six months afterwards the marquess of montalva
 and signor rulli <comma> his secretary <comma> were both murdered in their rooms at
 the hotel escurial at madrid <fullstop> the crime was ascribed to nihilism <comma> and
 the murderers were never arrested <fullstop> inspector baynes visited us at
 baker street with a printed description of the dark face of the
 secretary <comma> and of the masterful features <comma> the magnetic black eyes <comma>
 and the tufted brows of his master <fullstop> we could not doubt that justice <comma>
 if belated <comma> had come at last <fullstop>
 a chaotic case <comma> my dear watson <comma> said holmes over an evening pipe <fullstop>
 it will not be possible for you to present in that compact form
 which is dear to your heart <fullstop> it covers two continents <comma> concerns two
 groups of mysterious persons <comma> and is further complicated by the
 highly respectable presence of our friend <comma> scott eccles <comma> whose
 inclusion shows me that the deceased garcia had a scheming mind and a
 well-developed instinct of self-preservation <fullstop> it is remarkable only
 for the fact that amid a perfect jungle of possibilities we <comma> with our
 worthy collaborator <comma> the inspector <comma> have kept our close hold on the
 essentials and so been guided along the crooked and winding path <fullstop> is
 there any point which is not quite clear to you <question>
 the object of the mulatto cooks return <question>
 i think that the strange creature in the kitchen may account for it <fullstop>
 the man was a primitive savage from the backwoods of san pedro <comma> and
 this was his fetish <fullstop> when his companion and he had fled to some
 prearranged retreat--already occupied <comma> no doubt by a confederate--the
 companion had persuaded him to leave so compromising an article of
 furniture <fullstop> but the mulattos heart was with it <comma> and he was driven
 back to it next day <comma> when <comma> on reconnoitering through the window <comma> he
 found policeman walters in possession <fullstop> he waited three days longer <comma>
 and then his piety or his superstition drove him to try once more <fullstop>
 inspector baynes <comma> who <comma> with his usual astuteness <comma> had minimized the
 incident before me <comma> had really recognized its importance and had left
 a trap into which the creature walked <fullstop> any other point <comma> watson <question>
 the torn bird <comma> the pail of blood <comma> the charred bones <comma> all the mystery
 of that weird kitchen <question>
 holmes smiled as he turned up an entry in his note-book <fullstop>
 i spent a morning in the british museum reading up on that and other
 points <fullstop> here is a quotation from eckermanns voodooism and the
 negroid religions
 the true voodoo-worshipper attempts nothing of importance without
 certain sacrifices which are intended to propitiate his unclean gods <fullstop>
 in extreme cases these rites take the form of human sacrifices
 followed by cannibalism <fullstop> the more usual victims are a white cock <comma>
 which is plucked in pieces alive <comma> or a black goat <comma> whose throat is
 cut and body burned <fullstop>
 so you see our savage friend was very orthodox in his ritual <fullstop> it is
 grotesque <comma> watson <comma> holmes added <comma> as he slowly fastened his notebook <comma>
 but <comma> as i have had occasion to remark <comma> there is but one step from
 the grotesque to the horrible <fullstop>
